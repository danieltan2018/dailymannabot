Today's passage is another such occasion where David managed to escape from Absalom's army. As in an earlier incident when David escaped Saul's assassins through the help of his wife Michal [1 Samuel 19], here he receives help from those God sent.\n\nAs soon as Hushai left the meeting with Absalom and his generals, he hastened to report to David via the priests Zadok and Abiathar as instructed by David earlier [2 Samuel 15:35]. The two priests then sent a maidservant to relay this information to their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz who were waiting by the spring at Enrogel outside Jerusalem. There was no time to waste as it was likely Hushai did not know which proposal Absalom had adopted, his or Ahithophel's. Even if Absalom had accepted his, there was still the danger he could change his mind. David must immediately cross the Jordan before he and his troops are \"swallowed up\" by Absalom's army.\n\nAs followers of our Lord Jesus Christ, we too can call upon the Lord in our hour of distress and know that our cry will come before Him, even into His ears [Psalm 18:6]. Rest assured that the King of glory and Lord of hosts [Psalm 24:10] is able to deliver in the manner that is best for us and for the glory of His own name.",

Realising they had been spotted, the two messengers fled and coming to a certain house in Bahurim, hid in the well in the courtyard. The brave woman of this house covered the well with a cloth, pretending to be drying the corn laid out on top of it. Her bravery and presence of mind saved their lives because Absalom would surely have killed them all if he found out the truth.\n\nThis nail-biting episode is yet another example of how the Lord used an ordinary woman to fulfil His plan for the redemption of mankind. We are reminded how Rahab saved the two spies in Jericho [Joshua 2] and ultimately became grafted into the line of David's ancestors. We also think of Esther, who apart from her physical beauty, was just an ordinary Jewish girl. But God used her to rescue the Jews from annihilation by Satan during the time of the Medo-Persian Empire. Thus preserved the children of Israel to welcome their Messiah, who would be born to the family of Joseph some four and a half centuries later.\n\nThe lesson of these stories for ordinary people like us is that we must be ready to serve the Lord when the opportunity arises; \"and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\" [Esther 4:14].",

The villain's plan is thwarted, and our hero escapes. Exciting though the narrative has been, still we all know there will be a happy ending because of the spoiler in verse 14, \"that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom\".\n\nThis is the case throughout the Bible, whether it was the fate of Joseph in the Egyptian prison, Daniel in the lions' den or Mordecai in the Persian court. We know how the story will end because its Author says, \"I am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure\" [Isaiah 46:9b-10]. No wonder, Elwood McQuaid, author of the book It is No Dream, said that the history of Israel is pre-written history. God has already recorded it for us in Scripture.\n\nThis knowledge should give us the confidence to face the trials of life because we know who holds tomorrow. Warren Wiersbe said in his book, On Being a Servant of God, \"If God has called you to minister, no matter what that ministry may be, He hasn't made a mistake.

        "part5": "Seeing that Absalom had rejected his counsel and chosen instead to listen to David's friend, Ahithophel decided to end his own life. His treacherous scheme to eliminate the former king had failed. His dreams had crumbled, and his carefully laid plans had come to nought. Hence, while David travelled to Mahanaim, Ahithophel returned to his home, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. What caused him to do such a tragic thing?\n\nFirstly, he could not bear the shame of being slighted. His ambition of being the power behind the new king appeared to be on the way to fulfilment until this unexpected turn of events. Secondly, his hope of leading the attack and basking in its victory had evaporated, leaving him without the power he sought. Thirdly, he assessed that inexperienced Absalom would be defeated. Given the needed time to recoup, David's battle-hardened and deeply loyal fighters would decimate Absalom's forces, after which he would be executed as a traitor. Basically, like Judas Iscariot, he must have sensed that he had been used by Satan and realised it was futile to \"kick against the pricks\" [Acts 9:5].\n\nAhithophel's fate teaches a precious lesson for all who live for the world, seeking wealth and success. Soon we will discover that all is vanity; and when things do not go our way, then there is nothing left worth living for. Let us seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness; let us wait on the Lord, and He will grant us the desires of our heart.",

Mahanaim was a fortified city with walls and gates, a suitable place to take refuge in [2 Samuel 18:24]. Importantly, Mahanaim was where David would be able to gather reinforcements. Mahanaim was also where the angels of God had met with Jacob, and where Jacob declared upon seeing the host of God's angels, that \"this is God's host\" [Genesis 32:1-2].\n\nAs David passed over to Mahanaim, Absalom too crossed the Jordan with his forces and pitched in the land of Gilead. Having accepted Hushai's advice, Absalom was now ready with all the men of Israel to engage David. Absalom replaced Joab with Amasa as the commander of Israel's army, appointing another of David's nephews to take charge of taking David's life.\n\nAbsalom's rebellion is staggering. He was not content with having ravaged his father's concubines openly [2 Samuel 16:22] and chasing his father out of Jerusalem to the other side of Jordan. At this point it was likely that Absalom had been already anointed as king [2 Samuel 19:10]. Yet Absalom's hunger to secure the crown and kingdom would not be satiated until he had utterly eliminated his father.\n\nAbsalom's open revolt turned a nation against itself, pitting family member against family.

These men met David in his need with great sympathy and substantial gifts.\n\nSo not only did David find refuge in Mahanaim, he also found hope in unlikely allies. This was the first sign that not everyone in Israel had fallen away from him. David and his men were comforted and relieved of hunger and weariness by these people's kindness. These men remain honoured today by their legacy of loving God and succouring God's people in their difficult times.\n\nDavid was bereft of position, home, family and nation, but found comfort in the all-providing God. All manner of provision was made to David in a timely way. In the wilderness they had suffered want and scarcity. Here, they received plenty from their hosts and were strengthened for the battle ahead. Our God is a refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

It would be interesting to go into David's mind and know his thoughts as he prepared to face his son in battle. It must have been a great conflict for him having to struggle between his being a king who has to put down an insurrection and his role as a father who loves his son. Victory is a must for David. However, victory for David would mean that his son would have to face the consequences for his sedition and treason. This would be a story without a happy ending.\n\nWe can go further back in time to see the causes that led to this sad state of affairs in the royal household. There were several factors, but it began with his sin of adultery with Bathsheba, which was compounded by the sin of deceit and the murder of Uriah when David tried to hide the first sin. The cover up gave Joab a hold over David.\n\nA second factor was David's failure as a father. He did not discipline his sons when they committed egregious sins. David did nothing when Amnon violated Tamar, and he also did nothing when Absalom killed Amnon to avenge Tamar's honour [2 Samuel 13]. David's failures to discipline his sons led to an erosion of the people's support for him, leading to the crisis at hand.",

The three-pronged attack was a common military manoeuvre of this period [Judges 7:16; 1 Samuel 13:17].\n\nAbsalom led his large army of inexperienced men under the command of Amasa, across the Jordan and encamped in the land of Gilead [2 Samuel 17:24-26] to battle his father. David boldly assumed leadership to go with his men who were risking their lives for his cause, but was persuaded to remain at Mahanaim with the reserves both for his protection and to defend the city. The men said, \"Thou art worth ten thousand of us\" [v. 3], even if half of them died, the rest would carry on. But if David was killed, the cause was lost. So David acquiesced to their request. \"What seemeth you best I will do\" [v. 4].\n\n\"Whether the people's prudence had an eye to it or no, God's providence wisely ordered it, that David should not be in the field of battle; for then his tenderness would certainly have interposed to save the life of Absalom, whom God had determined to destroy.\" (Matthew Henry)",

Though Absalom premeditated Amnon's murder in revenge for his sister, abused David's concubines, conspired against God's anointed king, and set out to kill his father and appoint himself king, David still loved this wayward son very much. The love that David had for his son blinded him to the many defects and malicious designs of Absalom, a rebel against God's kingdom who deserved judgement and the death penalty.\n\nNatural affection is a good thing [Romans 1:31] but not the only thing to consider; there are other priorities. What did our Lord Jesus teach about the relationship between natural affection and kingdom priorities? Read Matthew 10:34-39. Natural affection must be regulated to the honour of God.\n\nOnly God deserves our supreme devotion. There is no divided allegiance where He is concerned. \"No man can serve two masters\". No human love must be allowed to keep us from doing what He wants done. King David failed in this regard, behaving as a natural father would, rather than God's anointed. Whenever natural affection and partiality affect the judgement of God's leaders, it will lead to disagreement, discord and discouragement among His people.

Casualties among his troops numbered over 20,000 soldiers. Better-disciplined and better-led than the hastily mustered forces of Absalom, the soldiers of David broke the ranks of their enemies and sent them to seek shelter in the dense forest. The battleground was well suited to David's experienced and brave soldiers rather than the many inexperienced men of Absalom. \"The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion\" [Proverbs 28:1].\n\nThe woods devoured more people than the sword. The verb \"devoured\" literally means \"to eat or consume\". Even the woods are dangerous when you are out of the will of God by being disobedient to His cause! God intervened on David's behalf. David's troops were able to use the rugged terrain and dense growth of the forest to their advantage. Perhaps wild beasts that infested the forest killed many distracted and displaced Israelites.

He was in a great predicament, rendered completely defenceless and hanging helplessly where he could be mocked by any passers-by. This would have been especially humiliating for Absalom who was greatly concerned with people's opinion of him.\n\nWorse than that, we see that material advantages could not give Absalom victory over David. Although Absalom had plotted this rebellion deviously and won the hearts of the Israelites, in God's eyes Absalom was just another rebel. The Israelites might believe that Absalom was the rightful king, but the Bible is clear that the Lord hates a rebellious son [Proverbs 15:5,20; 30:17].

As such, David, subject to human weakness and fatherly love, had given the command for his soldiers to be merciful to his son, which would have adversely impacted his soldiers' morale.\n\nDespite his many faults, Joab was loyal to David. Here, we see his obedience was a subjective one. He was prepared to disobey David for what he believed to be for David's own good. It is possible Joab had good reason for killing Absalom. By doing so, Joab eliminated the possibility of future threats against David. But Joab put Absalom to death in a cruel and merciless manner. He stabbed him through the heart and then left his men to finish him off.\n\nLet us be reminded that unlike Joab who was subordinate to a king who had his many moments of human weakness, we have a God who is never weak or wrong. He is perfect even in mercy and judgement. As such, we must not be selective in submitting to His commands. Often, it is easy to obey God when it is convenient to do so.

We may see that hanging on the tree parallels past hangings of Israel's accursed enemies [Joshua 8:29; 10:27]. We may also see that the disposal under stones is suggestive of the punishment God had ordained for rebellious children [Deuteronomy 21:21].\n\nAs we read this account of Absalom's death, we may feel a sense of justice served. We may believe that Absalom received his just deserts. A rebellious child is universally disliked in any society today. Let us consider the Old Testament punishment and death reserved for rebellious children. The truth is that, like Absalom, we are also guilty of the sin of rebellion against our heavenly Father. Just as we may have felt that justice was upheld in Absalom's death, we should not forget this is the same way justice will be upheld if we were subject to the Law.\n\nThen let us consider how our Lord Jesus Christ's death on the cross and subsequent burial has put an end to that Law's requirement and satisfied its penalty. Our Lord Jesus died a painful, merciless death on our behalf. The wrath God poured out upon our Lord that day at Calvary was fury that we have incurred through our rebellion.

        "part5": "Verse 18 is a postscript of Absalom's life. It was his eulogy after his death at the hand of Joab, but it was not a very flattering one. Absalom was known for his looks. The Bible says that \"from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him\" [2 Samuel 14:25]. He wanted to be known for his greatness. He also had grandiose ideas about himself.\n\nPresumably, Absalom contrived a scheme to perpetuate his memory after he was allowed to return to Jerusalem. As he rose in popularity, we read that \"in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar ... and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place\". The word \"place\" literally means \"hand\", speaking of his \"accomplishments\". But what great deeds had Absalom accomplished up to the day of his death? Consider what Absalom would be known for? His dastardly act of fratricide [2 Samuel 13:28-29] and an attempted regicide [2 Samuel 15:14].\n\nSee the vanity of Absalom in raising a pillar to his own name! Note also its futility. He had intended the monument to be a record of his greatness after his death because he had no son, but it became a memory of his shame. Absalom might have wanted the pillar to be his cenotaph, but he was ignominiously buried in an unmarked grave under a heap of stones.\n\nLearn the lesson of Absalom's life and death - beware of the instruments of vainglory; beware of the allure of ill-gotten gains; beware of pride and self-glory.",

Inevitably, the news of Absalom's death must be told to his father. Ahimaaz the son of Zadok offered to bring the news to David [v. 19].\n\nAhimaaz's loyalty to David was without question. At a time when the hearts of men were stolen by Absalom [2 Samuel 15:6], Ahimaaz remained loyal to the old king even when he was fleeing for his life [2 Samuel 15:27, 36].\n\nAhimaaz's enthusiasm, however, was curbed by Joab's astuteness. It could be that Joab was wise to know that the king would react unfavourably to the news of his son's death. Joab was keenly aware of David's love for Absalom. And the report of Absalom's defeat, far from being the news of victory, would bring much distress for David because winning the battle would mean his losing his son. It could also be possible that the bearer of bad news would bear the brunt of David's sorrow and fury.\n\nOn a more cynical note, Ahimaaz was prevented from carrying the news to David because Joab was afraid that he would be exposed for defying the king's explicit orders to spare his son [v. 5]. Perhaps, that is why Joab sent Cushi instead, who being a foreigner would have known nothing of David's original order.\n\nAhimaaz was enthusiastic about bearing the news of the death of a son because of his devotion to David. We too have similar tidings - the sacrificial death of the Son. Let us be just as prompt in our devotion to our Lord Jesus Christ and in the dissemination of His Gospel.",

Ahimaaz's persistence paid off in the end. \"Run\" was Joab's response as he acquiesced.\n\nThe battle was fought in \"the wood of Ephraim\" [v. 6b], which was a thick forested area east of the Jordan River. The Cushite took the road over the hills in a straight southerly direction toward Mahanaim. It was a shorter but a more difficult route.\n\nAhimaaz, on the other hand, \"ran by the way of the plain\", which was the name of the Jordan valley near Jericho. This route would mean that Ahimaaz first must head west across the Jordan River before heading south. The two routes would eventually converge a short distance from Mahanaim. The \"way of the plain\" was longer, but it was an easier route. So, Ahimaaz \"overran Cushi\".\n\nOn Ahimaaz's enthusiasm and persistence, Charles Spurgeon comments, \"In reading this passage, it strikes me that if men vie with each other in common matters, and one outruns the other, I ought to be in solemn earnestness so to run that I may obtain.

As he drew nearer, a second runner was sighted. David perceived both runners were bringing news [v. 26]. The watchman then made out the first runner to be the son of Zadok. Hearing his name, David concluded that Ahimaaz being sent must indeed mean good news. \"He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.\" Underlying David's words is his assumption a good man must bring good news.\n\nWhat would be good news for David? It would be what he desired to hear; that the life of Absalom was spared. That, however, was not to be. David would soon learn that his rebellious son was dead.\n\nWhat would be good news for a sinner? The Gospel, of course; that God loves us and sent His only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, into the world to save us from our sins and provide the way to everlasting life. But the Good News would also mean the \"bad news\" of the death of the rebellious heart. The Good News that gives hope also reveals that all men are sinners and unless they repent and place their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Saviour, there awaits every sinner God's fearsome wrath and eternal judgement.

A Christian brother was getting married to a non- believer and his friends did nothing to stop him. Years down the road after their divorce, he came to his friends and said: \"You knew I was doing the wrong thing but you did nothing about it, how can I call you guys my friends?\"\n\n\"A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity\" [Proverbs 17:17].

David knew he deserved death for his sins, yet he was alive, and his son lay dead. God's chastisement and discipline was more painful than death for him. However, despite the anguish and sorrow David felt through God's discipline, there was also much grace in store for him. As we will see in the days ahead, God loved David and chose his son (from Bathsheba), Solomon, to be the next king. Solomon would be the richest and wisest king in Israel's history.\n\nIn times of sorrow and grief, the person we need most to be with is our Lord.

God has given each of us at least a talent and ministry; it may be as a church leader or other roles in church ministry, or it could be a ministry elsewhere, such as taking care of our children's spiritual growth at home, or being a testimony at work or school. We are to magnify our Lord in these roles by our thoughts, words and deed. Being sensitive to others does not only mean attending to their physical needs. Even machines can do that nowadays. Sensitivity and concern should stem from empathy towards others, and by esteeming them higher than ourselves [Philippians 2:3-4]. Heed these words from the apostle Paul, and live it in our lives, so these qualities will manifest not just in our actions, but also our words and attitudes toward others.\n\nThank God for faithful friends, even one like Joab, whom God used to turn the mourning and sorrowing of King David, and raise him up again from the pit of self-pity.",

If not, the consequences would be far worse than anything he had experienced before.\n\nRemember, this is David who had faced great dangers in his life: As a shepherd boy, he had fought off predators; he had slain a giant. David had to flee for his life from a vengeful king; and suffered the betrayal of his own son. Yet if David did not heed Joab's warning and persisted in his dismal state, his people would abandon him. He would be deserted and defenseless, and his kingdom would be vulnerable to defeat by their enemies.\n\nThese words went straight to David's heart. Likewise, the Lord Jesus' words to the woman at the well [John 4:18] was like a dagger to her heart. Although proven to be effective in these narratives, we have to carefully determine if they are necessary.

Had David not spoken kindly to his servants and sat as the king in the place of authority (sitting at the gate), the people would have departed in discouragement and left David defenseless and susceptible to defeat. Humility precedes restoration. The Lord Jesus humbled Himself by taking on flesh and dwelling among man and is now exalted at the right hand of God. Joseph, the beloved child of Jacob, was humbled through many painful experiences before being elevated to be the exalted administrator over all Egypt.\n\nIn like manner, unbelievers have broken their fellowship with God. Only when we humble ourselves seeking God for repentance and acknowledge that we cannot save ourselves, will our fellowship be restored. And as sinners saved by grace, we are promoted to a higher position, to not only judge the world but to also judge the angels [1 Corinthians 6:2-3].\n\nAs Christians in the process of sanctification, may we put on \"humbleness of mind\" [Colossians 3:12].

The repetition of the pronoun \"ye\" underscores David's relationship with these leaders: \"Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?\" [v. 12]\n\nThough it can be read as a veiled threat, it seems more likely David's message was intended to build alliances rather than intimidate. David seeks to re- establish his rule in Jerusalem without resorting to armed force. So he opts for reconciliation with his rivals including Absalom's commander, Amasa, who is to replace Joab. By swearing an oath before God that Amasa will replace Joab as David's army commander, David establishes a truce with Amasa, and Amasa brings the people of Judah who had sided with Absalom, back to David.\n\nAlthough there were political reasons for Amasa's appointment, David sought reconciliation instead of violence to regain the throne. As Paul instructed in Romans 12:18b, we are to \"live peaceably with all men\". Reconciliation does not bear grudges, but rather forgives the past. Remember we were once sinners estranged from God, yet God offered peace to all who believe and repent. And because of God's grace and mercy, not one sin is held against us.

David didn't sway just a few, but all the men of Judah unanimously. Their desire for David's return could not be coerced, their hearts had to be swayed.\n\nMany parallels can be made between David's restoration to the throne of Israel and God's restoration to the throne of our hearts. Like David, God will not force His reign on us. We must welcome Him into our hearts. Just as the people of Judah were swayed by David's appeal of reconciliation and forgiveness, we are swayed by the grace and the mercy of God. And just as David's relationship with the people was restored, so is God's fellowship with us restored upon repentance.\n\nDavid's reign and restoration required the continual support and submission of the people. Likewise, for God to continue to reign in our hearts, we must submit our lives to Him without reserve.

He hurled curses and threw stones at David and his men as they came to Bahurim, blaming the demise of Saul and his house on David, and exulting that his dismal situation was his deserved punishment. The distraught and weary David then, had received Shimei's accusation with humility. He did not retaliate but turned to the LORD.\n\nIn today's verses, the situation has changed dramatically. David was returning to Jerusalem in jubilation after Absalom's rebellion was quelled. And Shimei was among the first to welcome him - he together with a thousand men of Benjamin, even crossed the Jordan before David so that they could be rightly seen as receiving him home.\n\nWhat caused this change of attitude in Shimei? We can only see one reason - fear. His earlier speculation was wrong. Absalom's revolt did not end David's reign. King David's return would mean Shimei was in big trouble. Thus fearing for his life, Shimei was trying to reverse his past folly. There is no evidence of genuine repentance in Shimei. But it is evident he is trying to save his own skin.\n\nThis reversal of allegiance will prove to be a matter of convenience and his respite temporary. Years later in David's final instructions to Solomon, it becomes clear that David had seen through Shimei's hypocrisy. David said to his son, \"Now therefore hold him (Shimei) not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood\" [1 Kings 2:9].",

Shimei is a good example of one who does not watch his tongue. To be fair, it was natural for Shimei to think negatively of David's reign, given that he was also from the house of Benjamin. In the annals of history, this is something new kings have always to deal with - the sentiment and allegiance of those who served and prospered under the previous, and especially if the new king was from a different house.\n\nHad Shimei kept his thoughts to himself then, he would not be caught in the situation we read today. He had humiliated and mocked the king publicly - the allegations were so serious and his attitude so disrespectful that the king's men had wanted to kill him there and then [2 Samuel 16:9]. Now that the king is back, it is almost impossible not to deal with this public transgression that had been committed.

In his own words, \"It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day\" [2 Samuel 16:12]. Now that everything has been set right for David, Abishai again asked for Shimei's head, \"because he cursed the LORD's anointed\" [v. 21]. But again, David had two thoughts in sparing Shimei's life now: first, he said, \"What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me?\" Shimei had brought along one thousand men from Benjamin in homage [2 Samuel 19:17]. If David were to kill Shimei, it might strain the relationship between him and the house of Benjamin. Then, more importantly, David also said, \"Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?\" Being able to return to Jerusalem, David was grateful. God had chastised him and then shown mercy. He should therefore be gracious and grant forgiveness to another who now came before him expressing repentance. \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\" [Matthew 5:7].

Ziba said then, \"Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father\" [2 Samuel 16:3b]. By Ziba's account, Mephibosheth was rejoicing over David's departure and chose to stay in Jerusalem waiting to be restored to the throne. David had reacted hastily then and transferred everything in Saul's house to Ziba's ownership [2 Samuel 16:4].\n\nNow, Mephibosheth came with a different story. But first we note his appearance. He \"had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace\". Mephibosheth was apparently mourning for David when he was away, which begs the question David asked, \"Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?\"\n\nDavid had made an impulsive and hasty decision when he gave all of Saul's property to Ziba. Treacherous Ziba had caught David in a state of weariness and confusion from all his troubles. David should have composed himself, prayed for guidance and listened to both sides of the story.\n\nOur vision is often obscured by our circumstances. We cannot see beyond our predicament.

Ziba furthermore slandered him before David saying Mephibosheth had stayed back with the intention of hoping to be the next king.\n\nHearing this account, which is entirely different from Ziba's, we can imagine David's confusion. He probably regretted his hasty decision to punish Mephibosheth by giving all to Ziba. But Mephibosheth had not come seeking redress for his grievances. Neither did he blame David for believing Ziba and making his uninformed (and unwise) judgement. Instead, Mephibosheth called David \"an angel of God\" who is entitled to \"do therefore what is good in thine eyes\".\n\nHis rationale was this: \"For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?\" [v. 28]. Mephibosheth realised that if not for the hesed love and mercy of David before, he would not have survived till this day. How could he then demand anything from David?\n\nThis is the condition of mankind as well. If not for God's covenantal love, we would be nothing but condemned sinners.

But David did not do so, instead he decided to let Ziba and Mephibosheth divide Saul's land.\n\nMost commentators would say it was Ziba who lied; it is quite difficult to see how Absalom's revolt would lead to lame Mephibosheth being restored. But correct or not, David's decision to divide the land seemed to have brought the case to a close. We are not told of Ziba's response to having half of his property returned to his former master, but we read here that Mephibosheth was grateful. He said to David, \"Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house\" [v. 30]. He would let Ziba have everything as long as David returned. That was his only concern.\n\nPerhaps some of us are not satisfied with how this matter was resolved. Surely the liar must be punished, and the rightful owner restored all he had lost.

To Barzillai, it was his privilege and honour to serve the God-anointed king. The king's recompense for his loyalty was great indeed. Believers called to heaven one day will be amazed at the great disproportion between the recompense and their service rendered to the Lord Jesus Christ on earth [Matthew 25:37-40; 1 Corinthians 3:14].\n\nBarzillai humbly declined the king's invitation to live in his palace giving the reason \"I am this day fourscore years old\" [v. 35a]. His impaired faculties of taste and hearing would not appreciate the pleasures of the court. His frail body would lack the vigour to be engaged in its affairs and activities. The pleasures and attractions of the world held no appeal to him anymore. These are not the complaints and moanings of a demented old man but wise words of a venerable one who was fully contented with his state. \"Godliness with contentment is great gain\" [1 Timothy 6:6]. Conscious that the end of his earthly sojourn was drawing nigh, he wished to die in his city and be buried beside his parents. He looked forward to going \"home\". So Barzillai offered in his place his son Chimham to follow and serve the king.\n\nAs we sojourn for a brief season in this world, may the Lord free us from its attractions and entanglements to look forward to the heavenly home already prepared for us. \"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

It is most likely that those were from the tribe of Benjamin, who were already with David before the war with Absalom. David's hold on the throne, however, was not secured as yet.\n\nHe had barely crossed the Jordan before rivalry arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel. The latter accused the men of Judah of stealing the king from them [v. 41]. The men of Judah, on the other hand, claimed that they were just close relatives [v. 42]. The contention was sharp between them. The men of Israel argued that they had \"ten parts\" in the king, and they had \"also more right in David\" than the men of Judah [v. 43].\n\nHowever, \"the words of the men of Judah were fiercer\". The word \"fierce\" is translated as \"grievous\" [1 Kings 12:4] or \"cruel\" [Genesis 49:7]. The words of the men of Judah became harsher as they hardened their stand. And they prevailed.\n\nThis fraternal contention was never resolved, driving a wedge between Judah and the rest, which eventually led to disunity, schism and war.\n\nQuarrels result from unfulfilled desires [James 4:1]. And the war of words often results from accusatory speech provoking an equally incensed response. Solomon reminds us that \"a soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger\" [Proverbs 15:1].

        "part5": "The first two verses stated that even though Sheba a man of Belial (wicked), a Benjamite, persuaded the northern Israelite tribes to abandon David, Judah remained loyal to King David. Sheba chose this critical time to stage a revolt for several reasons. First, he had a personal agenda. As a loyalist to Saul who was also from the same tribe, he saw his chance to oppose David. Second, he was an opportunist, taking advantage of David's weakened position following the unrest of the people due to Absalom's failed rebellion. Third, he had no regard for God, who raised David's kingship.\n\nSheba's folly is defiance against God. He rejected God's choice of David as king. He dismissed David's right to rule over him or the ten tribes of Israel (\"we have no part in David\"). He despised David's humble beginning as the son of Jesse (\"neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse\"). He caused the people to desert David (\"every man to his tents, O Israel\"). As a result, Sheba succeeded in drawing away the ten northern tribes, and David faced another civil war.\n\nWhat does the Bible say about those who foolishly choose to oppose God? \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh\" [Psalm 2:2-4a]. \"The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming\" [Psalm 37:13].

        "part5": "This action on David's part to house and care for his concubines but separate himself from them might seem strange. There are reasons. First, David took pre-emptive measure. He did not want a repeat of his concubines being openly abused by Sheba which was what Absalom did [2 Samuel 16:20-22]. Second, David knew the shameful deed committed by Absalom was part of the consequences of his sins of adultery and murder even though through repentance he had been forgiven. \"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife\" [2 Samuel 12:10]. Third, as a result, David knew the civil war sparked by Sheba was no accident but in keeping with God's Word to him. Fourth, by providing for the women, keeping them safe and leaving them alone, proved David's sincerity he would have nothing to do with more wives. Fifth, David cast himself upon the Lord's mercies for His help and deliverance.\n\nNone of us can say we are not as bad as David in his testimony of shame. We echo the prayer of Moses, \"Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance\" [Psalm 90:8].

Hence Amasa was the cousin of Joab as well as Absalom (David's son). During Absalom's revolt Amasa was his military commander. After Absalom's death, David was invited back to Jerusalem and restored as king. There he re-appointed Amasa as his military commander in place of Joab [2 Samuel 19:13]. That act by David to register his unhappiness with Joab for killing his son Absalom, would later play a part in ending Amasa's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Amasa failed in carrying out David's order to assemble the men of Judah within three days to capture Sheba. To David, time was of the essence. But Amasa \"tarried longer than the set time\". Either he needed more time, or owing to his previous allegiance to Absalom, the men did not trust him enough to follow him. In either case, he did not show up. There was also no record that Amasa informed the king of his delay or explained his disappearance. Hence David took preventive action in case Amasa had turned traitor and joined up with Sheba.\n\nIn discharging our duty to man, we must not forget that we are accountable to God.

When David heard about Sheba's rebellion, he ordered Amasa, his chief-of-army to gather troops and return to Jerusalem within three days. As Amasa did not show up by the deadline, David authorized Abishai to take command of the king's forces to pursue Sheba.\n\nAbishai immediately sprang into action. His willingness to stand in the gap showed not only his loyalty to David but also his spirit, courage and readiness in service. Consider his stellar record. In 1 Samuel 26:7ff, Abishai was the only one who accompanied David when he went to Saul's camp and took the spear and water bottle from the sleeping king. In 2 Samuel 21:15-17, Abishai's timely intervention in killing Ishbibenob rescued an exhausted David from death. In 2 Samuel 23:18, Abishai lifted up his spear and slew three hundred.\n\nTruly we need fellow workers like Abishai in the ministry of the Gospel. Paul wrote to believers, \"Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles\" [Romans 16:3-4].

Joab went along with his brother Abishai. The two men had fought together in the battle and defeated Absalom.\n\nThe background here is that when David replaced Joab as army chief in favour of Amasa, Joab was humiliated. From David's perspective he had reason to demote Joab because he had disobeyed and killed his son Absalom. From Joab's perspective, he regarded Amasa as a traitor who did not deserve the promotion because he had betrayed David and led Absalom's rebel army [2 Samuel 17:25]. Joab also despised Amasa as being too weak to lead the army. While these bitter thoughts were coursing through Joab's mind, imagine his surprise when Amasa appeared at the great rock in Gibeon. It was an opportunity to get rid of him. And that was what Joab did in devilish style, masking any suspicion Amasa might have. He used his right hand of fellowship in a deceitful way and with a heartless kiss to numb his victim, then Joab administered the fatal blow.\n\nHere is the lesson: never harbour hatred and bitterness in the heart even if it seems justifiable. Hatred is murder at heart. Sin is a poor pay master. Confess it, repent and get right with God. Proverbs 26:24-25 tells us: \"He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.\"",

Death even if not swift was sure.\n\nThis was an act of treacherous cold-blooded murder.

That this act was perpetrated against the king's appointed who was also a close kin, that it happened between two comrades-in-arms under the guise of goodwill, highlights the utter blackness of the human heart when it is possessed by the base instincts of the carnal soul. Displaced as the commander of David's army by Amasa, Joab was utterly consumed by rage, jealousy, envy and selfish ambition to regain his former position, and we are given a gruesome picture of the depths of wickedness man can plunge to when the evil within him is untethered.\n\nWe may not commit murder like Joab, but the feelings that drove him are common to all men on this side of eternity and can easily cause us to be angry, jealous, envious and selfish.

The able leader of David's army, he was bold in speaking his mind with the king. David owed much to Joab for his military endeavours. He consolidated David's kingship by defeating Abner, Saul's general. He defeated the powerful Ammonites and Syrians, removing a great threat to Israel and in that battle procured Uriah's death for David thus having a hold over him for the rest of his life. Joab was a soldier's soldier wielding great influence over Israel's army and commanding the men's loyalty. For these reasons, David feared Joab.\n\nJoab was also astute in sizing up people and situations. He discerned David's fondness for Absalom and engineered his return from exile after Amnon's murder. In Absalom's attempted coup, Joab ostensibly sided with him but when Absalom appointed Amasa instead to lead his army, Joab returned to David. There he solidified his position by blatantly disobeying the king and vengefully killing Absalom. David evidently distrusted Joab, ousting him in favour of Amasa to quell Sheba's rebellion, but Joab would reclaim his position by murdering Amasa too. Today's reading shows us the soldiers' loyalty to him.\n\nAs with his sons, Amnon's and Absalom's sins, David overlooked Joab's wicked acts and duplicity out of expedience and fear of the powerful general. And we are reminded that the best of men is at best still a man. Putting man before God displaces Him and breaks the first commandment [Exodus 20:3]. It offends and dishonours Him greatly.

Both were recipients of grace and therefore they owed a debt of love and obedience to their king. But Joab was enraged when David had ousted him as army commander. Amasa and Joab were close kin, fellow generals and brothers-in-arms but Joab was without compunction about slaying the man who occupied the position he coveted.\n\nAmasa was the king's appointed.

David's resoluteness this time differed markedly from his reaction to Absalom's rebellion. Then he behaved as a father, now he acted as a king. And as the king's army led by the popular general Joab (who meanwhile has opportunely disposed of David's appointed commander Amasa) pursued Sheba, he was forced to flee north in his quest for supporters to join his cause. Abel and Bethmaachah are two places near the northern Transjordan city of Dan. But even here, deep in northern territory, the men were not all with Sheba and many fell on Joab's side. Here in the fortress town of Abel, Sheba holed up with his rebels as Joab breathed down his neck. The failure of Sheba's rebellion is a corollary to the development and rise of David's kingship.

Nothing happens by chance in God's world. Sin begets consequences. In many ways, David's travails and testings prefigure Him of whom David was but the forerunner. The Greater David would be perfectly sinless and pure, yet He was rejected and despised by His own. He was killed, only to rise in triumph again. Praise our Risen Lord!",

Why so? David had recently just recovered from Absalom's rebellion. That uprising was primarily an internal matter for David and Judah, but it had caused great rifts and sorrows within the tribe. A rebellion by Sheba would involve other tribes especially Benjamin and those who resented Judah because her representative now occupied the throne after Saul's downfall. Left unchecked, the danger was very real, it could spread like a wildfire and engulf the whole country in civil war.\n\nSo David's army surrounded the city. They had no quarrel with the citizenry, only with one man. But on account of that one, this extreme measure was taken.\n\nThe presence of sin in our lives is like a Sheba. Sin in the household of faith is like a Sheba. It corrupts that which has been sanctified by the Holy Spirit. Tolerated and ignored, it will fester, spread and destroy the whole body. Sin must be confronted and dealt with resolutely. Surround an entire city for one man?

This statement compelled Joab to think again about destroying it. He would be destroying \"a city that was a mother in Israel.\" This meant it was a prominent city in a preeminent place. It was a capital city in the northern region of Israel. Bethmaachah was a big satellite city surrounded by smaller villages and towns. She reasoned with Joab that it did not make sense for him to destroy an entire city in order to capture one man, Sheba.\n\nGod gives each of us a mind and a freewill, and we are to exercise these so we can understand what God is teaching us.

The Lord Jesus, the son of God, averted the destruction of man by offering His own life for all. However, there is a world of difference in that while Sheba was a rebel who deserved his final end, the Lord Jesus is the sinless Son of God, the innocent Paschal lamb and our redeemer.

The eight men headed four departments - defence, finance, archive, religion. A similar list is found in 2 Samuel 8:15-18.\n\nWhen we compare the two lists [2 Samuel 20 and 8], there are two notable changes; first, the department of finance has been added; the other significant change is that David replaced his sons with one cabinet member. David, it seems, values competence and loyalty over familial ties.\n\nServing in David's cabinet was not some plush job. David was surrounded by conflict from the time he was a young man in the court of King Saul to the present day. Yet, several of these men had followed David long before he became king. They never wavered in their loyalty to him, even at times when their lives were put at risk.\n\nThe Bible reminds us that if the world persecuted our Lord Jesus, we should not expect to be spared [John 15:18-20]. Paul described Priscilla and Aquila as his \"helpers in Christ Jesus: who have for My life laid down their own necks\" [Romans 16:3-4].

Despite his kinship with David and the office he held, Joab's loyalty to David was checkered. Joab defied the orders of the king and murdered Abner to avenge his brother's death [2 Samuel 3:27-30]. He took Amasa's life [2 Samuel 20:8-13]. He killed Sheba, who opposed David [2 Samuel 20:16-22]. Joab lobbied for the return of Absalom [2 Samuel 14], who also died at his hand [2 Samuel 18]. He also supported Adonijah as David's successor [1 Kings 1:7].\n\nSecond in command was Benaiah, who took charge of the Cherethites and the Pelethites. These were Philistine mercenaries employed as David's personal bodyguards. To hold such a position, Benaiah must have the absolute trust of David. After David's death, Benaiah would later execute Joab at Solomon's orders [1 Kings 2:29], and replace him as commander of the army of Israel.\n\nTwo men on the same career path. Both equally gifted. But Joab was an opportunist who would stop at nothing to be in power. In his warrior heart, Joab hid a selfish and insubordinate attitude.

One would think that this job was not as hazardous as Benaiah's, but he would be tragically stoned to death by the people of Israel [1 Kings 12:18].\n\nJehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder. He must have been a well respected and faithful official in David's court because he served David from the beginning of his reign and continued into Solomon's reign. As recorder, his responsibility was to keep an honest impartial account of the king's deeds. Sheva was the scribe - David's personal secretary.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the ancient kings saw the value of record-keeping. Case in point: when Ahasuerus could not sleep, he asked that \"the book of records of the chronicles\" be read to him [Esther 6:1].

The noun \"priests\" [kohen] appears some 750 times in the Bible, and it refers to people who performed religious services, whether they were priests of Israel who ministered to the LORD in the Tabernacle or Temple; or priests of pagan nations who ministered to their idols. \"Priest\" can also refer to the special office of a \"priest-king\" such as Melchizedek who was king of Salem and the priest of the most high God [Genesis 14:18b; Exodus 19:6; Psalm 110:4; Isaiah 61:6; Zechariah 6:13]. On a few occasions, the word \"priest\" denotes a non-religious office. Ira the Jairite was designated the \"chief ruler\" [kohen] [v. 26; see also 2 Samuel 8:18; 1 Kings 4:5].\n\nThe priesthood has been part of God's plan of redemption from the beginning. It started with the patriarchal priests who made atonement for themselves and their family [Genesis 4:3; 8:20; 12:7; Job 1:5]. Then, God appointed Israel as a kingdom of priests, a holy nation [Exodus 19:6] and instituted the Levitical priesthood. The historical functions of the priestly office foreshadow that of our Lord Jesus who is our great High Priest [Hebrews 4:14], and in Him, we are a royal priesthood [1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6].\n\nIn David's council of only eight persons, three were identified as priests - Zadok, Abiathar and Ira. The religious makeup of David's governing council reveals his spiritual focus. \"Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; And the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance\" [Psalm 33:12].

The story unfolds with Israel suffering a three-year famine. This was the way God brought a past sin to David's attention. He \"enquired of the LORD\" and God said that the famine was caused by Saul's massacre of the Gibeonites. When Joshua first invaded Canaan, he was fooled by the Gibeonites, who lied about being from a distant land. Without seeking counsel from God, Joshua promised to preserve the lives of the Gibeonites [Joshua 9:15]. However, Saul disregarded the covenant and slew them. This massacre is not recorded in Scripture.\n\nInstances of communal guilt and punishment are not uncommon in the Bible. The Egyptians suffered for Pharaoh's defiance. Moses warned the children of Israel against idolatry because \"the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me\" [Exodus 20:5; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 5:9].\n\nCommunal blood-guilt seems to go against the concept of personal responsibility and equity, that it is only fair \"the soul that sinneth, it shall die\" [Ezekiel 18:20a; Deuteronomy 24:16]. The two ideas, however, are not contradictory. The Bible clearly teaches that sin will be judged and punished - a truth we do well to remember. That said, it would be erroneous to attribute every human suffering to sin [John 9]. On the other hand, the Bible also teaches that judgement of sin does not stop at the sinner's door. The effects of sin can run to the third and fourth generation.\n\nThis incident also teaches that God takes seriously every promise made. If you make a promise, be sure to keep it.",

There is no biblical record of this incident and we assume Saul did it in his zeal to rid the land of the heathen for the nation's good.\n\nAlas, Saul committed a grave sin when he did this because he broke a covenant Joshua made with the Gibeonites 400 years earlier. The Gibeonites were among the inhabitants of the Promised Land when Israel began to take possession of it and they had deceived Joshua into protecting them [Joshua 9:3-27]. The Israelites murmured against their leaders when the deception was uncovered but the oath had already been made and had to be kept. The Gibeonites were allowed to live but thereafter served Israel as slaves.\n\nSaul was Israel's king when he violated that covenant. Saul's \"bloody house\" and the Israelites were aware of Joshua's covenant with the Gibeonites but disregarded it. Now the whole nation was suffering its consequences. God brought about this famine to bring the transgression to the national consciousness.\n\nGod chastises His children and puts them through trials for a reason.

Likewise, God expects His children to be similarly faithful in keeping their promises and vows. God's honour is implicated in every vow and promise His people make. When Israel broke the covenant, they brought shame to His name. How were God's children supposed to display His holiness to the surrounding pagans if they themselves could not be trusted? How can we ask others to trust our Lord to save them from their sins if we blatantly disobey Him? Such hypocritical behaviour drives unbelievers away from God and mars their impression of the Gospel.\n\nSecond, time does not erase sins. The guilt of sin does not fade with time nor does delayed judgement imply God has forgiven or forgotten. Some years had passed since Saul's Gibeonite massacre and some might have thought God had overlooked it. However, there is no statute of limitation which applies to sin and God's demand for justice. Saul and Israel had not repented of their sin so the famine was punishment for it. Saul's family would soon be called to account in judgement.\n\nMay God teach us to treat our vows and promises seriously so that His holiness and faithfulness will be reflected in our own faithfulness and integrity.

The Gibeonites had just to name their price and King David would pay them in full.\n\nThe Gibeonites did not seek financial compensation. The injustice against their people would be settled according to the law given by Moses. In Numbers 35:30-34, the Israelites were commanded to put to death anyone guilty of murder. No financial payment was accepted in exchange for sparing the life of the murderer because murder was a sin that would pollute the land. Payment of gold and silver would not do, nor could the Gibeonites demand the death of just any man in Israel. Saul was guilty and his house would have to bear the responsibility for his zeal and fervour in committing genocide against the Gibeonites. It would appear they had participated in this bloody campaign together with Saul.\n\nGod created Man and Woman in His image. In the Ten Commandments, God commands us not to kill. The Law of Moses clearly specified capital punishment for murder. The Gibeonites' request was not made with a vengeful spirit but entirely within the bounds of God's law. In the process of seeking justice, they would honour God. They would not take matters into their own hands in seeking revenge. There would be no escape for the house of Saul.",

        "part5": "The Gibeonites made a request for the lives of Saul's descendants. They did not demand it of their king. They had come before David, God's appointed ruler, because he called for them. It is now in King David's power to accede to or deny their request. He had to make a decision and must do so wisely. Even as Saul's ungodly actions had brought famine and suffering upon the land, David's decision would have far-reaching effects not merely on the aggrieved Gibeonites but on the entire nation. And David approved their request.\n\n\"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin\" [Deuteronomy 24:16]. Surely David knew the writings of the Law and was familiar with God's instruction in it. What then are we to make of his approval of the Gibeonites' request? It implies there were men of the house of Saul who were involved in his attack on the Gibeonites for he could not do it alone. It was the lives of these guilty ones that the Gibeonites asked David for. Thus, it required David's awareness of the background and situation coupled with God-given wisdom in making his decision. Although the Gibeonites had deceived Joshua into making a truce [Joshua 9:4-6], a covenant had been made and it was sin to break it as King Saul did even many years later. Kings and rulers must rule righteously for thus is the throne established [Proverbs 16:12].",

        "part5": "David remembered the oath he swore with Jonathan, Saul's son. \"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed forever\" [1 Samuel 20:42]. David was a man of honour. He kept his word because he was God-fearing and God-honouring. Thus he was also gracious and merciful, not vindictive, but continually seeking God's wisdom and will in his actions. These actions would have far-reaching consequences for he was Israel's king. While Saul broke Joshua's truce with the Gibeonites, David would not break his covenant with Jonathan.\n\n\"If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth\" [Numbers 30:2]. \"I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep Thy righteous judgments\" [Psalm 119:106]. By choosing to obey God and honouring the oath, David showed mercy and spared Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth. The child of God must honour the oath they have made. God Himself is faithful in His Covenant of Grace towards sinful, unrighteous man, granting forgiveness to all who believe on His Son, the Lord Jesus, and His atoning death and glorious resurrection.",

        "part5": "These seven sons of Saul were paying not for their father's sin, but for their being personally complicit in his sin, otherwise this would have been in violation of God's word in Deuteronomy 24:16. God had brought famine upon the land for the crimes which they and their father Saul had committed. Perhaps many years had passed and they thought they had gotten away unpunished or even forgot about it. This was not to be. God's word of warning from Moses applies to us today, that if we are not guiltless before God, \" ... be sure your sin will find you out\" [Numbers 32:23b]. Let this be a warning to us that we are to repent of our sins immediately and seek His forgiveness.\n\n\"Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him\" [Isaiah 3:11]. The Gibeonites did not seek silver nor gold, for life is more precious than money. As man is made in the image of God, the shedding of man's blood had to be paid for by the shedding of the guilty's blood [Genesis 9:6]. They did not impose on David to execute but took the seven sons of Saul and carried out the execution themselves, hanging them \"in the hill before the LORD\". This denotes they held deference to God's will in their action and not their self-will. He that is hanged is accursed [Deuteronomy 21:23]. The number seven denotes completeness - full satisfaction for the evil deeds of Saul and his house.",

        "part5": "Rizpah was Saul's concubine [2 Samuel 3:7], and mother of two of the slain. She kept vigil before the hanging corpses of her sons and her five nephews. Sackcloth symbolizes mourning and she used this to create a shelter at the rock. Even as she mourned, she did not take down the bodies of her loved ones but had watched over the decomposing corpses, preventing the birds and beasts from getting to them.\n\nThe execution took place at the beginning of the barley harvest which is in April. She waited till the rains came and the famine was lifted. This would have meant God was appeased. The Hebrew for the phrase \"water dropped upon them\" suggests large amounts of water and heavy rain. If this refers to the heavy rain corresponding to the normal seasons of Israel, it would be about the month of October. The devotion of Rizpah to her dead loved ones was clear for all to see. The hanging corpses served as a grisly reminder to them, that evil deeds of individuals could affect a nation and catch up with the perpetrators despite the passing of time.\n\nDespite the grim end of her sons and her extreme personal sorrow, Rizpah displayed extraordinary love and self-sacrificial devotion. Humble submission on her part to God's judgement through His ordained means was also evident for all to see. The arrival of rain sent by God marked His appeasement for the national sin.\n\nGod would use her amazing display of love to stir David's heart as he was informed [v.11].",
