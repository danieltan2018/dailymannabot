        "part5": "Abishai had wanted to kill Shimei since their first encounter [2 Samuel 16:9]. David had stopped him that time for two reasons: first, he saw Shimei's cursing as chastisement from God [2 Samuel 16:10- 11]; and second, in not retaliating, David had hoped for God's mercy. In his own words, \"It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day\" [2 Samuel 16:12]. Now that everything has been set right for David, Abishai again asked for Shimei's head, \"because he cursed the LORD's anointed\" [v. 21]. But again, David had two thoughts in sparing Shimei's life now: first, he said, \"What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me?\" Shimei had brought along one thousand men from Benjamin in homage [2 Samuel 19:17]. If David were to kill Shimei, it might strain the relationship between him and the house of Benjamin. Then, more importantly, David also said, \"Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?\" Being able to return to Jerusalem, David was grateful. God had chastised him and then shown mercy. He should therefore be gracious and grant forgiveness to another who now came before him expressing repentance. \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\" [Matthew 5:7]. As difficult as it is, we must control our natural impulse and instead show mercy. A spirit of forgiveness must fill and control our hearts.",

        "part5": "Our attention now shifts to Mephibosheth. In 2 Samuel 16:1-4, we read that his servant Ziba had come to David with a gift of supplies and stinging slander against his master. Ziba said then, \"Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father\" [2 Samuel 16:3b]. By Ziba's account, Mephibosheth was rejoicing over David's departure and chose to stay in Jerusalem waiting to be restored to the throne. David had reacted hastily then and transferred everything in Saul's house to Ziba's ownership [2 Samuel 16:4].\n\nNow, Mephibosheth came with a different story. But first we note his appearance. He \"had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace\". Mephibosheth was apparently mourning for David when he was away, which begs the question David asked, \"Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?\"\n\nDavid had made an impulsive and hasty decision when he gave all of Saul's property to Ziba. Treacherous Ziba had caught David in a state of weariness and confusion from all his troubles. David should have composed himself, prayed for guidance and listened to both sides of the story.\n\nOur vision is often obscured by our circumstances. We cannot see beyond our predicament. In times like these, take a step back, pray and ask for God's wisdom to see things in the right light. Be not hasty in our decisions especially in times of crises; commit everything to the LORD and wait upon Him.",

        "part5": "Mephibosheth presented his side of the story. Ziba had lied to him, saying he would prepare a donkey so lame Mephibosheth could follow David in leaving Jerusalem. The donkey did not come, and he had to stay behind [v. 26]. Ziba furthermore slandered him before David saying Mephibosheth had stayed back with the intention of hoping to be the next king.\n\nHearing this account, which is entirely different from Ziba's, we can imagine David's confusion. He probably regretted his hasty decision to punish Mephibosheth by giving all to Ziba. But Mephibosheth had not come seeking redress for his grievances. Neither did he blame David for believing Ziba and making his uninformed (and unwise) judgement. Instead, Mephibosheth called David \"an angel of God\" who is entitled to \"do therefore what is good in thine eyes\".\n\nHis rationale was this: \"For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?\" [v. 28]. Mephibosheth realised that if not for the hesed love and mercy of David before, he would not have survived till this day. How could he then demand anything from David?\n\nThis is the condition of mankind as well. If not for God's covenantal love, we would be nothing but condemned sinners.

On the other, there was Mephibosheth, whom David had promised Jonathan to take care of [1 Samuel 20:14- 15]. One of them had told a lie, and David could have asked for a trial to find out the truth. But David did not do so, instead he decided to let Ziba and Mephibosheth divide Saul's land.\n\nMost commentators would say it was Ziba who lied; it is quite difficult to see how Absalom's revolt would lead to lame Mephibosheth being restored. But correct or not, David's decision to divide the land seemed to have brought the case to a close. We are not told of Ziba's response to having half of his property returned to his former master, but we read here that Mephibosheth was grateful. He said to David, \"Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house\" [v. 30]. He would let Ziba have everything as long as David returned. That was his only concern.\n\nPerhaps some of us are not satisfied with how this matter was resolved. Surely the liar must be punished, and the rightful owner restored all he had lost. Yet who can hold on to any riches on earth for eternity? The things in this world are nothing compared to treasures in heaven.

Godly and wise, he revered God and all that is of Him. Despite his advanced years, Barzillai determined to support and accord affection and loyalty to his king [Romans 13:7]. He counted it his privilege and duty to sustain his king in fulfilling the purpose and will of his sovereign God. He understood that all his wealth was from God [Deuteronomy 8:18] who had sovereignly purposed and enabled him for such a time as this. God regarded Barzillai a \"very great man\" [v. 32b] not for his wealth but for his heart.

Beyond the needful sustenance provided by the aged saint to the king and his men, an endearing bond of love and friendship between them was born and sealed by the God of love, mercy and grace. How true that when brethren in the household of faith minister and co-labour with one another in unity, bonds of friendship and love are nurtured and strengthened.\n\nThough a king, David did not feel entitled to the kindness of his commoner-subject. He was grateful and ready to return Barzillai's kindness as he had previously done in reciprocating Jonathan's [1 Samuel 20:11-16; 2 Samuel 9:1-13]. We too can emulate David's example to manifest this wonderful fruit of the Spirit [Colossians 3:12].

Believers called to heaven one day will be amazed at the great disproportion between the recompense and their service rendered to the Lord Jesus Christ on earth [Matthew 25:37-40; 1 Corinthians 3:14].\n\nBarzillai humbly declined the king's invitation to live in his palace giving the reason \"I am this day fourscore years old\" [v. 35a]. His impaired faculties of taste and hearing would not appreciate the pleasures of the court. His frail body would lack the vigour to be engaged in its affairs and activities. The pleasures and attractions of the world held no appeal to him anymore. These are not the complaints and moanings of a demented old man but wise words of a venerable one who was fully contented with his state. \"Godliness with contentment is great gain\" [1 Timothy 6:6]. Conscious that the end of his earthly sojourn was drawing nigh, he wished to die in his city and be buried beside his parents. He looked forward to going \"home\". So Barzillai offered in his place his son Chimham to follow and serve the king.\n\nAs we sojourn for a brief season in this world, may the Lord free us from its attractions and entanglements to look forward to the heavenly home already prepared for us. \"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

It is most likely that those were from the tribe of Benjamin, who were already with David before the war with Absalom. David's hold on the throne, however, was not secured as yet.\n\nHe had barely crossed the Jordan before rivalry arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel. The latter accused the men of Judah of stealing the king from them [v. 41]. The men of Judah, on the other hand, claimed that they were just close relatives [v. 42]. The contention was sharp between them. The men of Israel argued that they had \"ten parts\" in the king, and they had \"also more right in David\" than the men of Judah [v. 43].\n\nHowever, \"the words of the men of Judah were fiercer\". The word \"fierce\" is translated as \"grievous\" [1 Kings 12:4] or \"cruel\" [Genesis 49:7]. The words of the men of Judah became harsher as they hardened their stand. And they prevailed.\n\nThis fraternal contention was never resolved, driving a wedge between Judah and the rest, which eventually led to disunity, schism and war.\n\nQuarrels result from unfulfilled desires [James 4:1].

        "part5": "The first two verses stated that even though Sheba a man of Belial (wicked), a Benjamite, persuaded the northern Israelite tribes to abandon David, Judah remained loyal to King David. Sheba chose this critical time to stage a revolt for several reasons. First, he had a personal agenda. As a loyalist to Saul who was also from the same tribe, he saw his chance to oppose David. Second, he was an opportunist, taking advantage of David's weakened position following the unrest of the people due to Absalom's failed rebellion. Third, he had no regard for God, who raised David's kingship.\n\nSheba's folly is defiance against God. He rejected God's choice of David as king. He dismissed David's right to rule over him or the ten tribes of Israel (\"we have no part in David\"). He despised David's humble beginning as the son of Jesse (\"neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse\"). He caused the people to desert David (\"every man to his tents, O Israel\"). As a result, Sheba succeeded in drawing away the ten northern tribes, and David faced another civil war.\n\nWhat does the Bible say about those who foolishly choose to oppose God? \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

        "part5": "This action on David's part to house and care for his concubines but separate himself from them might seem strange. There are reasons. First, David took pre-emptive measure. He did not want a repeat of his concubines being openly abused by Sheba which was what Absalom did [2 Samuel 16:20-22]. Second, David knew the shameful deed committed by Absalom was part of the consequences of his sins of adultery and murder even though through repentance he had been forgiven. \"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife\" [2 Samuel 12:10]. Third, as a result, David knew the civil war sparked by Sheba was no accident but in keeping with God's Word to him. Fourth, by providing for the women, keeping them safe and leaving them alone, proved David's sincerity he would have nothing to do with more wives. Fifth, David cast himself upon the Lord's mercies for His help and deliverance.\n\nNone of us can say we are not as bad as David in his testimony of shame.

Hence Amasa was the cousin of Joab as well as Absalom (David's son). During Absalom's revolt Amasa was his military commander. After Absalom's death, David was invited back to Jerusalem and restored as king. There he re-appointed Amasa as his military commander in place of Joab [2 Samuel 19:13]. That act by David to register his unhappiness with Joab for killing his son Absalom, would later play a part in ending Amasa's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Amasa failed in carrying out David's order to assemble the men of Judah within three days to capture Sheba. To David, time was of the essence. But Amasa \"tarried longer than the set time\". Either he needed more time, or owing to his previous allegiance to Absalom, the men did not trust him enough to follow him. In either case, he did not show up. There was also no record that Amasa informed the king of his delay or explained his disappearance. Hence David took preventive action in case Amasa had turned traitor and joined up with Sheba.\n\nIn discharging our duty to man, we must not forget that we are accountable to God.

        "part5": "Abishai was a military leader. He was the eldest son of Zeruiah, sister of king David. Abishai was also the brother of Joab and Asahel serving under David. When David heard about Sheba's rebellion, he ordered Amasa, his chief-of-army to gather troops and return to Jerusalem within three days. As Amasa did not show up by the deadline, David authorized Abishai to take command of the king's forces to pursue Sheba.\n\nAbishai immediately sprang into action. His willingness to stand in the gap showed not only his loyalty to David but also his spirit, courage and readiness in service. Consider his stellar record. In 1 Samuel 26:7ff, Abishai was the only one who accompanied David when he went to Saul's camp and took the spear and water bottle from the sleeping king. In 2 Samuel 21:15-17, Abishai's timely intervention in killing Ishbibenob rescued an exhausted David from death. In 2 Samuel 23:18, Abishai lifted up his spear and slew three hundred.\n\nTruly we need fellow workers like Abishai in the ministry of the Gospel. Paul wrote to believers, \"Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles\" [Romans 16:3-4]. The Lord has given us the privilege to serve Him in and through our church. Every leader needs the practical support of helpers to carry out the ministry of the Word of God.

Joab went along with his brother Abishai. The two men had fought together in the battle and defeated Absalom.\n\nThe background here is that when David replaced Joab as army chief in favour of Amasa, Joab was humiliated. From David's perspective he had reason to demote Joab because he had disobeyed and killed his son Absalom. From Joab's perspective, he regarded Amasa as a traitor who did not deserve the promotion because he had betrayed David and led Absalom's rebel army [2 Samuel 17:25]. Joab also despised Amasa as being too weak to lead the army. While these bitter thoughts were coursing through Joab's mind, imagine his surprise when Amasa appeared at the great rock in Gibeon. It was an opportunity to get rid of him. And that was what Joab did in devilish style, masking any suspicion Amasa might have. He used his right hand of fellowship in a deceitful way and with a heartless kiss to numb his victim, then Joab administered the fatal blow.\n\nHere is the lesson: never harbour hatred and bitterness in the heart even if it seems justifiable. Hatred is murder at heart. Sin is a poor pay master. Confess it, repent and get right with God. Proverbs 26:24-25 tells us: \"He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.\"",

Death even if not swift was sure.\n\nThis was an act of treacherous cold-blooded murder. As he had so done to unsuspecting Abner before [2 Samuel 3:27], Joab now dealt a similar blow to unsuspecting Amasa. That this act was perpetrated against the king's appointed who was also a close kin, that it happened between two comrades-in-arms under the guise of goodwill, highlights the utter blackness of the human heart when it is possessed by the base instincts of the carnal soul. Displaced as the commander of David's army by Amasa, Joab was utterly consumed by rage, jealousy, envy and selfish ambition to regain his former position, and we are given a gruesome picture of the depths of wickedness man can plunge to when the evil within him is untethered.\n\nWe may not commit murder like Joab, but the feelings that drove him are common to all men on this side of eternity and can easily cause us to be angry, jealous, envious and selfish.

        "part5": "Joab's relationship with David is enigmatic. He was the son of David's sister Zeruiah, and with his two brothers, among David's staunchest supporters. The able leader of David's army, he was bold in speaking his mind with the king. David owed much to Joab for his military endeavours. He consolidated David's kingship by defeating Abner, Saul's general. He defeated the powerful Ammonites and Syrians, removing a great threat to Israel and in that battle procured Uriah's death for David thus having a hold over him for the rest of his life. Joab was a soldier's soldier wielding great influence over Israel's army and commanding the men's loyalty. For these reasons, David feared Joab.\n\nJoab was also astute in sizing up people and situations. He discerned David's fondness for Absalom and engineered his return from exile after Amnon's murder. In Absalom's attempted coup, Joab ostensibly sided with him but when Absalom appointed Amasa instead to lead his army, Joab returned to David. There he solidified his position by blatantly disobeying the king and vengefully killing Absalom. David evidently distrusted Joab, ousting him in favour of Amasa to quell Sheba's rebellion, but Joab would reclaim his position by murdering Amasa too. Today's reading shows us the soldiers' loyalty to him.\n\nAs with his sons, Amnon's and Absalom's sins, David overlooked Joab's wicked acts and duplicity out of expedience and fear of the powerful general. And we are reminded that the best of men is at best still a man. Putting man before God displaces Him and breaks the first commandment [Exodus 20:3]. It offends and dishonours Him greatly.

He was forgiven by David and appointed commander of his army in Joab's place after the latter's killing of Absalom. But Joab did not hesitate in retaliating.\n\nBoth Joab and Amasa, though allied with Absalom before, received David's forgiveness. Both were recipients of grace and therefore they owed a debt of love and obedience to their king. But Joab was enraged when David had ousted him as army commander. Amasa and Joab were close kin, fellow generals and brothers-in-arms but Joab was without compunction about slaying the man who occupied the position he coveted.\n\nAmasa was the king's appointed. To raise a hand against him would be raising a hand against the king. Yet Joab was without regard for this as he was without regard for David's peace pact with Saul's general, Abner [2 Samuel 3:21] or David's explicit order to spare Absalom [2 Samuel 18:5]. All were ruthlessly killed by Joab. These were the traits of Joab - ingratitude, insolence and treachery - a cold-blooded killer who stopped at nothing to get what he wanted.\n\nThe reborn and regenerate man is not so. We, for whom our Saviour died, must be full of gratitude for the forgiveness received and live our lives as debtors to God's grace.

The king moved quickly, sending out Amasa and giving him three days to gather the men of Judah. When he failed to meet the deadline, the king dispatched Abishai to pursue Sheba. David's resoluteness this time differed markedly from his reaction to Absalom's rebellion. Then he behaved as a father, now he acted as a king. And as the king's army led by the popular general Joab (who meanwhile has opportunely disposed of David's appointed commander Amasa) pursued Sheba, he was forced to flee north in his quest for supporters to join his cause. Abel and Bethmaachah are two places near the northern Transjordan city of Dan. But even here, deep in northern territory, the men were not all with Sheba and many fell on Joab's side. Here in the fortress town of Abel, Sheba holed up with his rebels as Joab breathed down his neck. The failure of Sheba's rebellion is a corollary to the development and rise of David's kingship. In his long journey, despite the numerous mountain top and deep valley experiences of the shepherd king, we must discern God's sovereign hand in bringing all to pass. Nothing happens by chance in God's world. Sin begets consequences. In many ways, David's travails and testings prefigure Him of whom David was but the forerunner.

Why so? David had recently just recovered from Absalom's rebellion. That uprising was primarily an internal matter for David and Judah, but it had caused great rifts and sorrows within the tribe. A rebellion by Sheba would involve other tribes especially Benjamin and those who resented Judah because her representative now occupied the throne after Saul's downfall. Left unchecked, the danger was very real, it could spread like a wildfire and engulf the whole country in civil war.\n\nSo David's army surrounded the city. They had no quarrel with the citizenry, only with one man. But on account of that one, this extreme measure was taken.\n\nThe presence of sin in our lives is like a Sheba.

Sheva was the scribe - David's personal secretary.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the ancient kings saw the value of record-keeping. Case in point: when Ahasuerus could not sleep, he asked that \"the book of records of the chronicles\" be read to him [Esther 6:1]. That providential act of God was the turning point that delivered the Jews from genocide.\n\nThe most important record we have in our hands of God's doings is His divinely inspired Word. Our Lord Jesus urges us to \"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me\" [John 5:39]. Parents, rehearse the record of God's saving grace to your children because it is the \"holy scriptures, which are able to make [them] wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus\" [2 Timothy 3:15].",

        "part5": "The concept of priesthood is found in almost all ancient cultures. The noun \"priests\" [kohen] appears some 750 times in the Bible, and it refers to people who performed religious services, whether they were priests of Israel who ministered to the LORD in the Tabernacle or Temple; or priests of pagan nations who ministered to their idols. \"Priest\" can also refer to the special office of a \"priest-king\" such as Melchizedek who was king of Salem and the priest of the most high God [Genesis 14:18b; Exodus 19:6; Psalm 110:4; Isaiah 61:6; Zechariah 6:13]. On a few occasions, the word \"priest\" denotes a non-religious office. Ira the Jairite was designated the \"chief ruler\" [kohen] [v. 26; see also 2 Samuel 8:18; 1 Kings 4:5].\n\nThe priesthood has been part of God's plan of redemption from the beginning. It started with the patriarchal priests who made atonement for themselves and their family [Genesis 4:3; 8:20; 12:7; Job 1:5]. Then, God appointed Israel as a kingdom of priests, a holy nation [Exodus 19:6] and instituted the Levitical priesthood. The historical functions of the priestly office foreshadow that of our Lord Jesus who is our great High Priest [Hebrews 4:14], and in Him, we are a royal priesthood [1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6].\n\nIn David's council of only eight persons, three were identified as priests - Zadok, Abiathar and Ira. The religious makeup of David's governing council reveals his spiritual focus. \"Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; And the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance\" [Psalm 33:12]. It is the same with the family for \"except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain\" [Psalm 127:1].",

        "part5": "The last four chapters of 2 Samuel [chapters 21-24] give us a record of different periods of David's life, filling in the gaps in the life and reign of the man after God's own heart. The story unfolds with Israel suffering a three-year famine. This was the way God brought a past sin to David's attention. He \"enquired of the LORD\" and God said that the famine was caused by Saul's massacre of the Gibeonites. When Joshua first invaded Canaan, he was fooled by the Gibeonites, who lied about being from a distant land. Without seeking counsel from God, Joshua promised to preserve the lives of the Gibeonites [Joshua 9:15]. However, Saul disregarded the covenant and slew them. This massacre is not recorded in Scripture.\n\nInstances of communal guilt and punishment are not uncommon in the Bible. The Egyptians suffered for Pharaoh's defiance. Moses warned the children of Israel against idolatry because \"the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me\" [Exodus 20:5; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 5:9].\n\nCommunal blood-guilt seems to go against the concept of personal responsibility and equity, that it is only fair \"the soul that sinneth, it shall die\" [Ezekiel 18:20a; Deuteronomy 24:16]. The two ideas, however, are not contradictory. The Bible clearly teaches that sin will be judged and punished - a truth we do well to remember. That said, it would be erroneous to attribute every human suffering to sin [John 9]. On the other hand, the Bible also teaches that judgement of sin does not stop at the sinner's door. The effects of sin can run to the third and fourth generation.\n\nThis incident also teaches that God takes seriously every promise made. If you make a promise, be sure to keep it.",

David recognised it as divine chastening and sought its reason from the Lord, who revealed it to be the consequence of Saul killing some of the Gibeonites. There is no biblical record of this incident and we assume Saul did it in his zeal to rid the land of the heathen for the nation's good.\n\nAlas, Saul committed a grave sin when he did this because he broke a covenant Joshua made with the Gibeonites 400 years earlier. The Gibeonites were among the inhabitants of the Promised Land when Israel began to take possession of it and they had deceived Joshua into protecting them [Joshua 9:3-27]. The Israelites murmured against their leaders when the deception was uncovered but the oath had already been made and had to be kept. The Gibeonites were allowed to live but thereafter served Israel as slaves.\n\nSaul was Israel's king when he violated that covenant. Saul's \"bloody house\" and the Israelites were aware of Joshua's covenant with the Gibeonites but disregarded it. Now the whole nation was suffering its consequences. God brought about this famine to bring the transgression to the national consciousness.\n\nGod chastises His children and puts them through trials for a reason. He does not cause us to suffer for nothing. May we come before God in humility and seek His favour.

There are two more lessons God wants us to learn from the famine.\n\nFirst, our God is a faithful, covenant-keeping God. He does not break His promises, nor forget them. Likewise, God expects His children to be similarly faithful in keeping their promises and vows. God's honour is implicated in every vow and promise His people make. When Israel broke the covenant, they brought shame to His name. How were God's children supposed to display His holiness to the surrounding pagans if they themselves could not be trusted? How can we ask others to trust our Lord to save them from their sins if we blatantly disobey Him? Such hypocritical behaviour drives unbelievers away from God and mars their impression of the Gospel.\n\nSecond, time does not erase sins. The guilt of sin does not fade with time nor does delayed judgement imply God has forgiven or forgotten. Some years had passed since Saul's Gibeonite massacre and some might have thought God had overlooked it. However, there is no statute of limitation which applies to sin and God's demand for justice. Saul and Israel had not repented of their sin so the famine was punishment for it. Saul's family would soon be called to account in judgement.\n\nMay God teach us to treat our vows and promises seriously so that His holiness and faithfulness will be reflected in our own faithfulness and integrity.

But David understood that deeper issues were at stake. This transgression was not against the Gibeonites only but against God as well. Israel had to atone for their sins to satisfy God's justice. Israel's prayers would be in vain if they did not do right and make restitution. The famine would not end till God's wrath was propitiated. \"If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me\" [Psalm 66:18]. Israel had to do whatever it took to regain God's favour and blessing again.\n\nWe are all sinners deserving God's wrath and punishment, which is death. He is holy and our sins are so great that there is nothing we can offer to expiate our guilt. We are simply unable to save ourselves by anything we do. Thank God, He loved us so much He sent His only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to die on the cross to bear our punishment and atone for our sins. God gave us His Son to be our Saviour.

It implies there were men of the house of Saul who were involved in his attack on the Gibeonites for he could not do it alone.

Thus he was also gracious and merciful, not vindictive, but continually seeking God's wisdom and will in his actions. These actions would have far-reaching consequences for he was Israel's king. While Saul broke Joshua's truce with the Gibeonites, David would not break his covenant with Jonathan.\n\n\"If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth\" [Numbers 30:2]. \"I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep Thy righteous judgments\" [Psalm 119:106].

Let this be a warning to us that we are to repent of our sins immediately and seek His forgiveness.\n\n\"Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him\" [Isaiah 3:11]. The Gibeonites did not seek silver nor gold, for life is more precious than money. As man is made in the image of God, the shedding of man's blood had to be paid for by the shedding of the guilty's blood [Genesis 9:6]. They did not impose on David to execute but took the seven sons of Saul and carried out the execution themselves, hanging them \"in the hill before the LORD\".

It was a wise move to bring about unity in Israel.\n\nThe logic is simple. For the breaking of covenant, seven sons in Saul's house had to die. As king, it was hard for David to give such an order. And it was especially difficult for him, for this might be seen in man's eye as David's vengeful act for what Saul had done to him, or worse, as David's attempt to be rid of all possible future threats to the house of Judah. Perhaps, the least David could do was to show his goodwill by bringing the bones of Saul and Jonathan home. A failure to do so might cause resentment that could later escalate even to civil war.\n\nRather than regarding this act as David strengthening his position as king, we may see it more as his desire to keep Israel united.

He could have dismissed the sentiments of the people and self-righteously claim he was only doing the right thing under God's instructions to hand over Saul's seven sons to the Gibeonites, but he did not.

The Philistines hanged and exposed the corpses of the dead as a warning and a humiliation. The men of Jabesh-gilead took the bodies, burned them and then buried the bones. David took one step further; he honoured the dead by burying the bones in the family sepulchre.\n\nThere is a somewhat disturbing trend today in treating the dead as a thing to be disposed of in the most convenient way; that usually means - cremation.

But God saw everything, and in His time, punishment was meted out.\n\nYet this episode also tells us of God's faithfulness. God had revealed to David and the Israelites the reason for the famine, and He allowed His children to be at the mercy of the Gibeonites who stated their terms of restitution. Now with all requirements fulfilled, God lifted His hand of chastisement and \"was intreated for the land\".\n\nTo be sure, not all disasters are the consequences of man's sins, and no one can claim that the sufferings of any particular nation now are because of her people's transgressions. Yet crises are often good opportunities for us to consider our finitude, and to examine our ways before the sovereign God.

After David learnt the reason for the famine, he went to the Gibeonites and asked, \"Wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?\" [v. 3].\n\nGod takes the breaking of a covenant seriously. Covenant breaking has serious consequences. The famine [2 Samuel 21:1] is designed to get David's attention to the violation of the covenant and the need to mend the breach. The phrase \"to make the atonement\" means \"to cover\", and it has the idea of reconciliation. It has been pointed out that the word \"atone\" is made up of \"at\" and \"one\", and \"atonement\" literally means \"at-one-ment\".\n\nSin destroys our relationship with God. Sin separates us from our Creator. Sin cuts off His blessings. And the accompanying misery and guilt of sin is to awaken our conscience and show us our need for reconciliation. Atonement is the necessary step before our relationship with God can be restored. Thus, we must ask as David did, \"Wherewith shall I make the atonement?\" realising however, that our atonement can neither be purchased by gold and silver nor earned by good works, and the terms of atonement are not set by the sinner. Atonement involves the shedding of blood and death [Hebrews 9:22], and not of animals, but by the once-and-for-all offering of our Lord Jesus Christ to truly take away the guilt of sinners and give life to the repentant.",

From the giants of Anak which caused the Israelites to turn back and wander in the wilderness for forty years [Numbers 13:31-33] to David's slaying of Goliath [1 Samuel 17], their great stature reflects their seemingly impregnable strength. The spiritual lesson for a child of God is clear: if we are blinded by the physical appearance of our enemies, we will lead defeated lives - even before the battle has started. Conversely, if we trust in God and meet these challenges in His strength and for His name, God will certainly help us overcome them.\n\nThe first giant in this account is Ishbibenob. Verse 16 tells us of his weighty armour and new sword. David was an experienced fighter, yet we read that he \"waxed faint\". We do not know why David faltered but thank God Abishai, his nephew, was there to help him and this faithful companion slew the giant.\n\nNo matter how strong we are, there will definitely be times of weakness. Sometimes the challenge may be so daunting, but God has promised us always a way of escape [1 Corinthians 10:13]. For David here, help came in the form of one of his faithful companions. Do you have godly companions who can help you in times of temptations and distress? More importantly, are you an Abishai, a keeper to your brother or sister in Christ?",

David, in his heyday, was a warrior king, but age had caught up with him. This time as he led his army against the Philistines, he was faint. Seeing their king was no longer physically able to lead in battle, the mighty men of God led by Abishai bound themselves by an oath that David would never fight in person again, lest he be slain in battle and the whole nation suffer defeat with his death.\n\nThe light is proof of life and vitality, and the extinguishing of that light signifies decline and destruction [Job 18:5-6]. Here, Abishai and the others recognised David as the glory of Israel. The nation's existence and prosperity were bound to David's life. While no man is ever indispensable, history tells us that a man can carry the weight of a whole nation. So, it is to the credit of David's character and leadership that Abishai recognised him as the light and glory of Israel.\n\nThere is One greater than David who is not only the light of Israel, but the light of the world. He, of course, is our Lord Jesus Christ who reminds us that those who follow Him, \"shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\" [John 8:12], and that we are \"the light of the world\", and we are to \"let [our] light so shine before men, that they may see [our] good works, and glorify [our] Father which is in heaven\" [Matthew 5:14-16].\n\nAnd just as David's life was the light that God had lit for Israel's benefit, so our lives must be lit for the good of the world.",

The Israelites may have been thinking - when will this end? Why are we having to face constant harassment from the Philistines? When will peace come?\n\nThis is quite akin to our spiritual struggles. When it comes to matters of the heart and spirit, the battle may be even tougher. \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but ... against spiritual wickedness in high places\" [Ephesians 6:12]. Just when we think we have finally overcome one temptation and we can have a break, another testing comes up. In fact, the Bible warns against spiritual complacency, lest our initial victory causes us to be presumptuous, and our last state be worse than the first [Matthew 12:45].\n\nLet us therefore put on the whole armour of God, so we can stand against the wiles of the devil [Ephesians 6:11]. The enemy may attack in different ways and challenges come wave after wave, but take courage, there is only one way for us to respond. \"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you\" [James 4:7]. Trust the LORD and commit ourselves to Him, who will fight the battle for us [Exodus 14:14], and together with us [Joshua 1:9].

This has led some to say Goliath was killed not by David, but by Elhanan here. This interpretation is clearly unacceptable as it is contrary to Scripture [1 Samuel 17:51]. Neither is the suggestion that this is a different Goliath. A simple cross-comparison with 1 Chronicles 20:5 provides the answer: \"And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam\". The name of this giant is Lahmi and he is the brother of Goliath.\n\nMany a times, difficulties and controversies in interpretation can be resolved simply by seeking internal evidence within the Bible. A conscientious student of God's Word should seek the whole counsel of God by reading the Bible in its entirety, and learning to read every verse not only in its immediate context, but also with their parallel biblical narratives.\n\nTaking a step back, we can also see how the whole account of David's giant-slayers [2 Samuel 21:15-22] correlates to the account of his mighty men [2 Samuel 23:8-39]. There is also a similar parallel between 2 Samuel 21:1-4 and 2 Samuel 24, which focus on the theme of atonement. This draws our attention to what is central in the last four chapters of 2 Samuel - David's song of praise and his last words in 2 Samuel 22:1-23:7.

In his strength and might, he mocked the people of God - a reminder of what Goliath did in 1 Samuel 17. Soon he was slain by Jonathan, the son of Shimeah.\n\nVerse 22 brings us back to the focus of this section. The emphasis of this account in 2 Samuel 21:16-22 is not on the giants - they were all killed, no matter how big and strong they were. Like Goliath, they had sought to bring reproach to Israel and defied the armies of the living God [1 Samuel 17:26]. Like David, the Israelites were there defending God's name and kingdom. God's servants were the ones He would remember here - Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Sibbechai the Hushathite, Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, and Jonathan the son of Shimeah. They had defended their Lord's honour.\n\nIn our spiritual struggles, giants will come our way that we must take on.

His heart is flooded with praise and thanksgiving, and his response is to praise the Almighty God. In 2 Samuel 22, David's song is prefaced by a verse that tells us he wrote this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of his enemies, especially from Saul.

In such hopeless times, we can still praise God for the one hope left: the Lord Himself.\n\nWhen we are confronted by insurmountable odds, even the crisis of death itself, there is always this one hope: prayer - crying out to the Lord for deliverance. Thus we have a deeper appreciation for David's thanksgiving in verse 4, when he praises God for being always present to hear his cry.\n\nThere will be times when we are discouraged, when we are confronted with the most troubling issues, maybe the prospect of death. Do we give up? No, we have our Lord God. We can cling to Him and cry out for His face and mercy to shine on us. Do not fear but remember.

James 4:8a says, \"Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you ...\" As we grow closer to Him, we will cultivate a stronger faith that knows He will see us through our trials because He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us [Ephesians 3:20].\n\nAs David experienced first-hand, God will listen to our cries for help.

It is an amazing picture of God's power. The God who thunders, is the God who speaks powerfully against His enemies in order to deliver His people.\n\nThe wrath of God is one of God's attributes. It is needed for motivation to Christian living, for proper worship, and as a tool to confront objections to Christianity. God makes no attempt to conceal the fact of His wrath. Sin and God's holiness just do not mix; they cannot keep company. There is really no good way to soften the wrath of God to mean anything other than an angry response on God's part to human disobedience. God's wrath is not angry retribution against those who have offended Him. It is His righteous judgement against those who do evil.\n\nGod's wrath is never motivated primarily by a desire to punish but to bring people to repentance so that they may be saved. Even in His wrath, God remembers mercy. God demonstrates His mercy in wrath by never pouring out His wrath without much warning.

These are at His disposal to be dispatched swiftly whenever He utters His word of command.\n\nDavid in Psalm 97 spoke of the flashes of lightnings, \"His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled\" [Psalm 97:4]. At Mt Sinai, the glorious manifestation of God's presence was attended by thunderings and lightnings ... etc, so much so the Israelites trembled exceedingly. Such fearful forces of nature can still terrify us today as in the days of old.\n\nA lightning strike is an electric discharge between the atmosphere and the ground. It is only about one inch in diameter, but because of its extreme brilliance, it looks much larger to the human eye. Lightning discharges are typically miles long and sometimes occurring together in multiple strikes. The entire flash lasts only a fraction of a second at approximately 27,000 degrees Celsius and is enough to cause total damage and complete devastation. It is quite unthinkable how this can be inflicted on David's enemies.\n\nReminiscing the past deeds of the Lord, David prayed in Psalm 144:6 against his enemies, \"Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out Thine arrows, and destroy them\" [Psalm 144:6].

His testimony here should be read in the context of his actions concerning Saul as verse 1 tells us David wrote this song to thank God for delivering him from his enemies and from Saul.\n\nDavid had to live a fugitive's life for many years because of Saul's relentless desire to kill him. Although David could easily have avenged himself on two occasions, he chose not to. He held reverence for the Lord's anointed and great faith in the covenant-keeping God, leaving it entirely to Him to vindicate. God rewarded David for his obedience by delivering him from Saul. His deliverance was a vindication of His righteousness in His dealings with Saul.\n\nHow do you respond when others persecute you, are unjust or unkind to you? Do you respond in kind and harbour hatred, or do you persevere in obeying God's Word?

David was able to keep the ways of the LORD because he set God's judgment before him. The word \"judgement\" in the original Hebrew language has a broader meaning than what the English word suggests. It does not only refer to judicial matters but to the entire government. God is not only the judge. He has divine authority over the lives of His creatures. He alone can set the laws and exercise true ultimate rulership over His creation. In other words, God is sovereign over all. By setting God's judgements before him and not departing from them, David implicitly acknowledged God's sovereignty over his life and submitted to Him.\n\nNext, obedience requires knowledge of self. David recognised he had come short of God's glory and holiness. He admitted his iniquities and made effort to keep himself from them [v. 24]. He was aware of God's abiding presence and strived to be upright before Him.\n\nTo keep ourselves in the path of righteousness, we need to know God and know ourselves.

The first three have virtues that please God.\n\nThe first is the merciful man. Mercy consists of showing compassion to others, forgiving others, and helping those in need. To this man, God will also show mercy. The second is the upright man. To be upright is to be complete and blameless. Such a man is wholehearted in his commitment to God. To the upright, God will show Himself upright. The third is the pure man, one who keeps himself clean by separating himself from anything sinful or anything which may cause him to sin. The pure man is singular in his desire to please God. To such a man, God will show Himself pure.\n\nGod's justice is perfect. Both the righteous and the wicked will get what they deserve for their deeds. Whatever a person sows, he will reap [Galatians 6:7]. Whatever a person measures, the same will be measured to him [Matthew 7:2].\n\nKnowing that God will not overlook good deeds, believers should be motivated to do good. However, we must be careful we do not do good in order to be rewarded. Instead, we should recognise that ultimately rewards stem from God's grace, and it is our duty as creatures to obey our Lord.

God says, \"I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.\"\n\nIf proud and wicked men try to devise evil schemes against the innocent, God will outwit them and thwart their plans [v. 27b]. There are numerous examples in the Bible. The Book of Esther provides a classic example of how God judged proud and evil Haman. Haman had become one of King Xerxes' chief advisers, but power went to his head. When everyone began to kneel and pay him homage, he noticed that Mordecai, Esther's adoptive father, did not. Mordecai, being a Jew, knew God's command about bowing to anyone but the Lord. This infuriated arrogant Haman [Esther 3:5]. He went to the king devising an evil plan that would destroy Mordecai and the entire Jewish race. But through a series of 'coincidences' God rescued the Jews and Haman was hung on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.\n\nWe live in an evil and perverse generation where pride is taught as a virtue and unscrupulous methods often lauded as cleverness. May those who name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ never fall prey to such insidious philosophies. If we seek to be happy, to be led by the Spirit, to avoid destruction, we need to cultivate meekness and humility.",

One of the lowest periods in Israel's history was the era of the Judges; and the cause is well-known - \"every man did that which was right in his own eyes\" [Judges 21:25].\n\nThe golden age of Israel, a period when she enjoyed peace with the surrounding nations, her borders stretching from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, was during the reign of King David about the time when he penned this psalm in 2 Samuel 22. What was David's secret? He faithfully followed God's way. Whenever he led his army against Israel's enemies, he would first \"enquired of the LORD\" [2 Samuel 5:19, 23] and the result was \"And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him\" [2 Samuel 5:10].\n\nGod's way is the perfect way.

There is none beside Him, nor any like Him. There are many so-called \"gods\", but they are merely nominal deities, who are not by nature gods but fictitious ones, idols of pagans made of gold, silver, brass, wood and stone. Secondly, only our God is able to protect and save. Like other inspired writers of the Old Testament such as Moses and Isaiah, David refers to God as the Rock, a symbol of power, strength, protection and stability.\n\nDavid had experienced first-hand God's protection. From the lowest ebbs of life when he was fleeing from Saul to the jubilant times when he was victorious over Israel's enemies, \"the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went\" [2 Samuel 8:14b]. Likewise, God protected His servants like Joseph, Mordecai, Daniel and his three friends even as they were far from home and the temple, living under pagan kings and surrounded by idol worshippers.\n\nIn these perilous times we are living in, as the signs of our Lord's second coming increase and converge, God's people need more than ever the protection of this Rock. We need spiritual protection from false teachers and deceivers, and the moral decay around us. We need physical protection from pestilences, wars and natural disasters. In times like these, we too find comfort in David's declaration; \"Who is a rock, save our God?\"",

The deer skips from place to place with agility, seeming never to lose their footing. They bound unimpeded over the mountain tops. David acknowledged that God granted him the advantage by setting him on the high-ground in battle. These high places were the mountain strongholds, even Mount Zion, the occupation of which accorded him control of the land.

But he was conscious of God's continual hand throughout his life and in the constant preparation he underwent for the trials before him. When the battle came, God's divine enablement allowed David to overcome strong foes.\n\nWe may face numerous difficulties in life and be earnestly wishing for an easier time.

When Saul viciously sought David's life, he became a fugitive hiding in the mountains. There were no easy roads there he could travel on. As David scaled the pathways up the mountain peaks of life (seeking to conquer the trials and evade his enemies), the Lord gave him a wide path and kept his feet from slipping. It was as if God was there right in front of David, making a clear escape route for him to follow easily. \"Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip\" [v. 37].

David likely is recalling the events recorded in 1 Samuel 30.\n\nThere, during David's absence, an Amalekite raiding party had sacked and burned Ziklag,. They carried away David's family and all the inhabitants. David took counsel from God. In His providence, they found a sick Egyptian slave abandoned by his Amalekite master, who led the Israelites to the Amalekite's encampment. There David's men routed them and recovered all their families and properties. God provides believers with defensive protection and offensive power.

This was true not only of the Amalekites, but of all whom David engaged in battle. They were either slain or subjugated like the Philistines, Moabites, Syrians and Edomites [2 Samuel 8]. David spoke of the complete destruction of his enemies in verses 38, 39 and 43.

After he was anointed, he slew the Philistine Goliath to defend the Lord's honour [1 Samuel 17].\n\nLater, God delivered David from the constant attacks of Saul, and from Absalom's rebellion. His rise to power and prominence was in God's sovereign hand. David's lust led him to commit gross adultery and murder. His penitence spared him personal death. He praised God as his rescuer, refuge, his source of strength and victory. He knew it was God who preserved his life. He was restored to a vibrant relationship with the LORD. If a man like David can give God the glory, certainly we should as well.\n\nDavid was a man of war throughout his life [1 Chronicles 22:8]. With the LORD's strength, he had killed many of Israel's (that is God's) enemies. He defeated Israel's arch-enemy, the Philistines [2 Samuel 5:17-25]. Their defeat and the Mediterranean Sea secured their western front. With the Moabites subdued, the desert provided a safe border to the east. In the north, David defeated Hadadezar and the Aramaeans at Damascus, and in the south Edom and Hamath were subdued [2 Samuel 8:6, 14; 1 Chronicles 18]. In these regions, garrisons were established for defence.\n\nThis key statement is repeated twice: \"And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went\" [2 Samuel 8:6, 14].

This was despite the fact that some of his adversaries were much stronger and more powerful like Goliath, the Philistines and even King Saul.\n\nAs such, when we read of David's victories over his enemies, we should realize this was a result of the continual and constant relationship he had with God. Complete triumph over God's enemies is something equally available to us in this day and age. These may not be physical enemies threatening our lives, but unseen spiritual foes tempting us to sin against God, and undermining our faith and confidence in Him. The Bible promises that just as David won a complete victory over his enemies, we too can have victory over the spiritual foes as we nurture our relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ [Romans 8:34; 2 Corinthians 10:4; Colossians 2:12- 15].\n\nLet us therefore not be discouraged when we recognise strongholds of sin in our life.

It is biblically attested that the world will hate Christians [1 John 3:13]. Yet despite the natural hatred which the world bears, God allows the faithful Christian to thrive in adverse circumstances so that the world cannot help but grudgingly acknowledge their successes and deeds.

We may be tempted to think the smooth-sailing state of our circumstances came about through our own hard work. David prevents himself from taking such credit by bringing to mind the fact that God exists, and He is the One who helped bring about his present good circumstances.\n\nThis is a good example to emulate. Besides keeping us humble and God-focused, intentionally remembering God's goodness to us in the past also strengthens and prepares us for adverse circumstances in the future. We will benefit from taking time to list the many ways God has blessed us, and praise Him for each item with thanksgiving. First, David acknowledged the living God as his source of support and salvation. Next, David praised God for avenging the wrongs done to him. He lists specifically what God had done - bringing many people under David's subjection, delivering David from his enemies, keeping him safe and out of harm's reach, exalting him above those who rose up against him, and granting him paths of escape from violent men and situations.\n\nAim to be like David.

Now that David was the paramount public figure in the kingdom, respected by both Israelites and the surrounding nations, he boldly declared God's goodness in a public setting. Even \"among the heathen\", David asserted he would continue giving thanks to the Lord. Unlike many Christians today who keep quiet about their faith when they are in the public eye, David used those situations to continue giving God the glory, despite the possibility his testimony might portray him as a weak man, one who was solely dependent on God!\n\nPerhaps we may be uncomfortable displaying such a \"weak\" image through constantly thanking God for all the things He has done for us. We may feel that the world will laugh at our complete reliance on Him. Let us examine if it is a matter of our pride and self-love. Let us also remember not to deceive ourselves.

If there is any question about who David was, the answer would be that he was the son of Jesse; he was raised up on high; he was the anointed of God; and he was the sweet psalmist of Israel.\n\nThe first statement points to his humble origin. David was the youngest of Jesse's seven sons from the nondescript town of Bethlehem. In other words, David was a nobody. Second, David was \"raised up on high\", meaning his accomplishments were not the result of his own abilities. From a shepherd David became king, but it was God who chose him and \"took him from the sheepfolds ... to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance\" [Psalm 78:70-71]. It was God who raised David up.\n\nThird, David was \"the anointed of the God of Jacob\". David was referring to the time when as a teenager he was anointed by Samuel to be king [1 Samuel 16:13]. The word \"messiah\" is a transliteration of the Hebrew word \"anointed\", meaning David was the man on whom God set His heart for His own purpose. David's greatness did not come from what he had done; rather, David was great because God had called and laid His purpose on him.\n\nFourth, David was \"the sweet psalmist of Israel\", meaning he was the composer of the psalms sung in Israel. And in his psalms, David points us beyond himself to his Greater Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nDavid's last words were not for self- aggrandizement. Rather, they are a testimony of what God had done in him, and what God can do in us when we \"yield (ourselves) unto God ... and (our) members as instruments of righteousness unto God\" [Romans 6:13b].",

This ruler's authority is not limited by earthly boundaries but prevails over all His creatures and creation. The distinct attribute of this Ruler is 'righteousness'. David's prophecy points to none other than the Messiah, our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords. Through His righteousness, the just and holy King has redeemed us.

God promised to establish the throne of his house forever. Indeed, there will be times when his descendants commit great iniquity, but God has promised that He will, after a period of right chastening, shower mercy upon them. God will preserve the Davidic line and this is the hope of the dying David - a steadfast hope in God Who orders the steps of a good man and upholds him with His hands [Psalm 37:23-24], Who is his salvation [Psalm 27:1] and his only desire [Psalm 27:4].\n\nYet David did not possess the full revelation of God's redemption plan. The reason the Davidic line was preserved was because the Messiah would be born to this house. That is why even when the kings of Judah after David were faithless, God remained faithful. He is faithful to His own covenant and will to establish the house of David.\n\nBelievers in the Lord Jesus Christ today inherit the blessings of the Davidic Covenant. Those who believe in the Lord Jesus are adopted into His kingdom to be co-heirs with Him, inheriting everlasting life and every spiritual blessing.

These were men who were committed not just to David but also to God's work. They did not abandon David when he was old; neither did they switch their loyalties when he was weak. These men stood together with David for the LORD.\n\nDavid had his mighty men. Paul had his co- labourers. In his epistles, Paul named his co- labourers - Aquila and Priscilla who for the work of the Gospel \"laid down their own necks\" [Romans 16:4]; Epaphroditus who ministered to Paul in prison [Philippians 2:25]. The work of the Gospel is too heavy for one person to carry. In his last letter, Paul lamented he was abandoned; no one stood with him; only Luke was with him, and he longed for the company of Mark [2 Timothy 4:11, 16].

And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken\" [Ecclesiastes 4:9-12]. This begs the question: Are you committed to the Lord Jesus Christ?

In David's eyes, the water represented the blood of the men who risked their lives, and this offering belonged to God alone.\n\nThe author did not reveal the names of the three, but the king knew who they were.

Even Joab had his reservations though he proceeded to carry out the census as David ordered. Could Joab have had done otherwise? It would be to the detriment of his personal safety and position as King David's right-hand man. Today's passage shows us how human government is fallible and imperfect. Nations and national leaders make decisions every day, and often because of man's sinful nature, the decisions are bad. As a result, we hear of troubles in many places. In history, the world suffered two world wars, and many other conflicts where innocent people are affected, even killed. Bad decisions are made by selfish and self-centred leaders without the conscience to realise their erroneous thinking; and by conceited rulers with misplaced notions of greatness and power because of the positions God has placed them in. We live in perilous times in an uncertain world. As God's children, let us be reminded we should not be part of the problem in this world, but rather to be witnesses and messengers for our Lord Jesus Christ, whose sole purpose for coming to this world was to save mankind from God's judgement upon a sin-cursed world.",

        "part5": "After Joab returned with the results, David's heart was pricked by the guilt of wrongdoing. David confessed to the Lord in contrition and sought His forgiveness for his foolish transgression. Though chosen and anointed by God, his human nature was still prone to sin, but David was quick to realize his iniquities, and quicker still to go to the Lord for forgiveness.\n\nToday's passage teaches us several precious lessons. The first, even though we are all saved when we confess our sins to the Lord, we, like David, are still weak and struggle with besetting sins in our lives. Let us realize we are all sinners and while still clothed in earthly flesh, we must contend daily with the temptations of sin in our lives. Like Paul (and David), we cry daily, \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" [Romans 7:24].\n\nThe second, as Christians having confessed and committed our sins to the Lord, we must still go each time to Him with humble and repentant hearts when we transgress. Our God is a loving and faithful God. If we truly repent, and forsake our sins, then He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness [1 John 1:9]. What wonderful grace from our heavenly Father! Let us therefore, boldly go before the throne of grace, to obtain mercy, and to find grace when we are tempted [Hebrews 4:16].",

        "part5": "In response to David's confession, the Lord's judgement was pronounced by the prophet Gad. David had three choices: endure seven years of famine in the land, be pursued for three months by his enemies, or suffer three days of pestilence. As Israel's king, all three were detrimental to the kingdom, but David had to choose one.\n\nAt times, we too have difficult decisions to make. It may not be as harmful or deadly as David's choices, but nonetheless, they are difficult ones. One thing we must ask ourselves and search our hearts is whether these choices were the consequence of our sinful actions, as in David's case. Did we obey the Lord fully in our daily lives and life choices? And even if we have not transgressed, realize God may allow difficult situations in our lives without giving us the reason until we meet Him in our heavenly home.\n\nWhat then? Shall we question God and be angry at Him? No, because we know and Scripture affirms that our God is compassionate and He always works things out for the good of those who love Him. We persevere and trust in His goodness and faithfulness to see us through whatever difficult situations we may be put in. Like David, our response to difficult choices should be: \"... let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for His mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man\" [v. 14].

And though David's sin was the immediate cause, the great increase of national offenses at this time had kindled the anger of the Lord [2 Samuel 24:1]. The irony is that David's sinful action of numbering the people was punished by the mass deaths caused by the pestilence. And if it were not for the mercy of God, more would have died [v. 16]. We must remember that sin must be punished. There is no way out; no way for David to escape God's punishment by compensating with good works or past merits. Sin will be punished. Due to man's wickedness God sent a global flood to wipe out all but eight people. Adam and Eve were punished for eating the forbidden fruit. David was punished for committing adultery. Does God punish each and every sin we commit? Yes! Although there may not be an immediate punishment directly following our sins, ultimately they are punishable by our eternal damnation. Yet the God of grace deemed it such that His only begotten Son would take the penalty for us on the cross. God's wrath towards sin was not withdrawn but placed instead upon the Lord Jesus. It was on the cross that His wrath was appeased, and our sins forgiven.",

The incident of the golden calf exemplifies for us that worship cannot be according to our preferences. Worship that deviates from Scripture is termed as \"strange fire\" [Leviticus 10:1]. God's Word should dictate our worship.\n\nThe \"regulative\" principle of worship is worship that is founded upon the instructions of Scripture. We know from Scripture that worship contains the \"reading, (and) exhortation\" of God's Word [1 Timothy 4:13]; and the singing of \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\" [Ephesians 5:19]. Although Scripture is silent on the circumstances of worship (length of time, start time, order of worship etc ...) we should follow the principle given to the church at Corinth that \"all things be done decently and in order\" [1 Corinthians 14:40].

No. Your \"sacrifice\" came at no cost. They were mere leftovers.\n\nDavid, however, knew that all genuine sacrifice comes at a price. To offer the Lord burnt offerings that cost him nothing would have been to David a sign of the deepest ingratitude. Although the owner offered them to David for free, he paid for the threshing floor, oxen and wood so that he could build a worthy altar to God. The woman who broke the costly jar of perfume and anointed the Lord Jesus in Mark 14 did so in worshipping Him. The wise men that travelled from afar came bearing valuable gifts of gold, myrrh and frankincense.\n\nIndeed, genuine worship comes at a price. It may require our time and commitment in service. It may require our money for the furtherance of the Gospel work. It may require our gifts and talents in the ministry. Worship is costly and requires our personal sacrifice not because God needs our sacrifice and money but because God is worth it. David worships God because in Him there is forgiveness and mercy in the abatement of the pestilence. Likewise, we worship God because in Him there is eternal life and victory over sin for us at the cross.",
