Paul, in his other epistles, uses a similar phrase - \"all things\" [see Romans 8:28, 37; 1 Corinthians 3:21]. \"These things\" point to God the Father in all His power, perfection, purposes and providence. It points to God the Son, in His redemptive work and ministerial intercession. It further points to God the Holy Spirit in His regenerating work, His sealing, His comfort and His convicting.\n\nThe work of salvation has opened for us the floodgate of God's blessings. As God's elect, we are kept under the canopy of God's loving care in all that we face - the world, life and death, the good days and bad ones, success and failure, health and illness, peace and turmoil.\n\nPeter puts it thus: \"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue\" [2 Peter 1:3]. What a promise! Though fraught we may be with challenges, yet we are not left helpless. So we go through life assured of God's saving grace, confident of His tender mercies, and certain that His providence, purpose and promise will always be for our eternal good.

The apostles, in the course of their ministry gave similar warnings: \"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you\" [1 Peter 4:12]. That \"we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God\" [Acts 14:22]. \"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution\" [2 Timothy 3:12].\n\nWe know that our enemies are manifold - the devil's snares and fiery darts, the world's ideas and vain philosophies, and the weaknesses of our own flesh. If we were to allow our own experiences to answer the question, we would surely be defeated. And when we are tempted to throw up our hands in despair, Paul puts forth five rhetorical questions; the first of which is: \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\"\n\nThese questions are designed to help believers deal with the fears that often lodge in our minds when our lives turn south. These questions help us to see the absurdity of the notion that God is unable to preserve and provide for those whom He has redeemed. Paul is reminding us we can be confident that \"He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ\" [Philippians 1:6].\n\n\"If God be for us, who can be against us?\" is also the great promise of God that He orchestrates all events for good to those who are called according to His purpose [v. 28].",

The accusations against God's elect however, continue till today. \"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?\" From whence do the charges come? From several sources: We are charged with Adam's sin. When he fell, all mankind fell with him. By his sin, \"judgment came upon all men to condemnation\" [Romans 5:18]. We are also charged with our own sins and lack of righteousness because we have \"all gone out of the way, (we) are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one\" [Romans 3:12]. We have committed a multitude of sins both before and after conversion. Our conscience also bears witness against us. Satan, the accuser of the brethren, accuses us before God day and night [see Revelation 12:10]. What is the answer to these charges? Christ has paid the debt of our sin in full. If Christ has paid it all, then nothing can be charged and no one can charge anything to our account. Since Christ has paid it all, these charges avail nothing because they have all been answered in Christ. In Christ, our sins are pardoned and we are imputed with His perfect righteousness. On account of His atoning work on the cross, God's justice has been totally satisfied. God justified in one place, in one time, in one sacrifice, all those He has purposed to save. It is God who justifies and no charge and no accuser can change God's mind. What good news this is, and what assurance God has given us.

In verse 33, the question is: \"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?\" This is a legal question. In a law court, who has authority to bring charges against another person? This question involves several presuppositions. It presupposes that there is an objective standard of righteousness. It presupposes that the person who has been charged has done something wrong. In the court of heaven, it has been established without doubt that we are sinners [Romans 3:23]. We are guilty as charged of breaking God's law. Will the charges stick? Absolutely. Are we condemned? Most certainly. The soul that sinneth shall die [Ezekiel 18:4, 30]. How does a sinner escape these charges? Will the love of the judge be enough to let a repeat offender off without consequences? That is inconceivable. God is good and loving, but also perfectly just. That is our problem. We are neither good nor righteous because we have violated God's Word. Our sin hauls us into the court and presence of the perfectly righteous Judge. This is really bad news for sinners. We cannot get off on a technicality. There is no loophole for us to wiggle out of our sin. God sees everything and \"all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do\" [Hebrews 4:13]. He will never let us off with a reduced sentence. We should expect nothing less than the full weight of God's judgment upon us. The only hope for sinners is that another person will bear the wrath of God on our behalf. That person is Jesus Christ. For (God the Father) hath made (God the Son) to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. - 2 Corinthians 5:21",

Put another way, to justify is a legal pronouncement that someone is in full accordance with God's law. He is not just acquitted of all charges, he is also freed from all judgment. If we keep God's law, we will be justified. But sinners are caught in a double bind. Not only do we not keep, we are also unable to keep God's law and lawbreakers must be punished because God has said, \"I will not justify the wicked\" [Exodus 23:7; 34:7]. So we are guilty and it would be against God's very nature to let sinners go unpunished for He has said, the man who \"justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just ... both are abomination to the LORD\" [Proverbs 17:15]. It is inconceivable that God would do what He Himself has called an abomination. Yet we read that \"it is God that justifieth\". Is it a contradiction? Absolutely not! For God to justify, sinners must be punished. Divine justification is not meted out at the cost of nothing. The circle is squared through the substitutionary atonement of Christ. Paul writes that God is \"just, and the justifier of (the sinner) which believeth in Jesus\" [Romans 3:26]. Jesus Christ \"Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree\" [1 Peter 2:24] takes our place at the judgment hall so that God is just and still justifies sinners.  Justification by faith in Christ alone is the main hinge on which the Christian faith turns (adapted from John Calvin).",

The only Person who might have the power to condemn us is Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God. If Jesus were not God, He would not have the power to judge. But the Father \"hath committed all judgment unto the Son\" [John 5:22]. Christ is \"ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead\" [Acts 10:42]. And in His hand is the fan of judgment with which \"He will throughly purge His floor, and gather His wheat into the garner; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire\" [Matthew 3:12; 19:28; Acts 17:31; Romans 14:10; 2 Timothy 4:1]. Christ alone has power to judge the world. However, there are things which He has done and is now doing that make it impossible for Him to condemn us. It is inconceivable He will condemn the person who comes to Him by faith and trusts him for salvation. This blessed truth is given a double assurance because Christ went to the cross to pay the penalty for the sins of the elect, and He rose again to secure the salvation of those who believe in Him. There is no way that Jesus - who died for His sheep, was raised to life for their justification, has ascended into heaven, and is now interceding for them - who has done such things for His people will turn around and condemn them. That would make His sacrifice on the cross farcical, and render our faith in Him most miserable.  Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and ye perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little.

The first reason is that Christ died for us. Why did He die? He died in order to make full payment for the sins of all who trust in Him. God has set forth Christ \"to be a propitiation through faith in His blood ... for the remission of sins\" [Romans 3:25]. A propitiation is a sacrifice which turns away wrath. God is justly displeased with us because of our sin, but His wrath was turned away from us onto His Son. As Christ was nailed to the cross, God's wrath was fully spent upon Him, so that there is none left to be spent on the person who trusts in Christ. Isaiah says it is God \"that pleadeth the cause of His people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again\" [Isaiah 51:22]. Paul reminds us \"Christ died for the ungodly ... Christ died for us\" [Romans 5:6-8]. Who is the \"us\"? The \"us\" are those who belong to Christ; those whom the Father gave to His Son before the foundation of the world; those who are His sheep [John 10:14-15]. The Father condemned the Son for the sin that is in us. That sin, having been condemned 2,000 years ago on Calvary cannot be condemned again. The fact that the One who will judge is the very same Person who made the payment for our sins upon the Cross means that He cannot possibly condemn us.  The cup of wrath which Christ drank to the last drop becomes the cup of blessing for us [1 Corinthians 10:16].",

THOUGHT  aul's second reason why Christ will not condemn the elect is that He is risen again. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is a historically verifiable fact. The empty tomb, His multiple appearances over forty days and to hundreds of people, the radical change in the apostles from fear and dejection to boldness in testimony, the downpouring of the Holy Spirit and the rapid growth of the church in spite of severe persecution all point to the fact that Christ did indeed rise from the dead. There is no other way of knowing if what Christ did on the Cross has been accepted by the Father other than His resurrection from the dead. The resurrection meant that the Father has accepted the sacrifice of the Son, and that what He did on the Cross was enough to pay for our sins in full. Paul says that Christ \"was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification\" [Romans 4:25]. This means that Jesus was given over to the power of death for our sins, but He was resurrected from the dead for our justification. Because He was raised, we are justified, no longer condemned; instead, we are declared righteous in God's sight. Not only is Christ risen from the dead, He is also given a place of honour at the right hand of God, with all authority in heaven and earth. The amazing blessing is that we who are in Christ are united with Him, raised up with Him, and seated with Him in heavenly places [Ephesians 2:4-7]. That I pray, is your hope and assurance!

In the original language this is a compound word which means \"to plead with someone\". In Romans 8:26, Paul tells us that the Holy Spirit \"maketh intercession for us\". The connotation here is \"to plead with someone for someone else\" - the Holy Spirit pleading with God for us. The emphasis is that intercession is being made for the sake of another. This is what Christ is doing; He intercedes for us. The ministry of intercession is our Lord's high priestly ministry. In Old Testament times, the high priest not only offered a sacrifice for sins, he would go into the holy of holies, bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his breastplate and the blood of the sacrifice he had made. There, he would plead on behalf of the people for God to show them mercy. The ministry of the high priest in the Old Testament foreshadows the work of Christ. The writer of Hebrews says that \"Christ being come an high priest of good things to come ... (not) by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us\" [Hebrews 9:11-12]. This is the present ministry of Christ. We do not travel through life alone. Christ walks with us. When we \"walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another\" [1 John 1:7].  We never pray to God alone because Christ prays with and for us.",

First, the high priesthood of the Old Testament was a temporary priesthood; whereas Christ is \"a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec\" [Hebrews 7:17]. Second, the high priest entered an earthly tabernacle made with hands; whereas Christ entered the perfect and heavenly tabernacle [Hebrews 9:11, 24]. Third, the high priest entered the tabernacle by the blood of goats and calves, which could never take away sins; whereas Christ entered by His own blood [Hebrews 9:12; 10:4]. Fourth, the high priest had to offer sacrifices year after year; whereas Christ offered Himself once for all and obtained eternal redemption for us [Hebrews 9:12; 10:3, 10]. Fifth, the high priest stood throughout his ministry, but Christ \"after He had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God\" [Hebrews 10:11-12], signifying that His work was done! Our Lord Jesus offered His own life and shed His own precious blood for us, and by His \"one offering, He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified\" [Hebrews 10:14]. And we can be confident that He \"is able also to save (sinners) to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them\" [Hebrews 7:25]. Sin will never again stain and condemn the soul of the Christian because \"if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous\" [1 John 2:1].

The Christian's walk has its ups and downs; the pathway is narrow and punctured with pot-holes. Sometimes, it is mundane, even dull. At other times, there are steep inclines and hazardous obstacles - tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, or sword. Our life circumstances are not indicative of our spiritual state. Proverbs 24:16 says \"a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.\" The wicked man falls, and the just (righteous) man falls; in fact, it appears that the just man falls many more times than the wicked. The measure of our spiritual well-being is our relationship with God, not what happens to us or how adept we are in overcoming life's obstacles. It is Christ and His love in our lives that keep us to Him. This verse is crafted as a rhetorical question. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? The answer is that nothing will. The word \"separate\" is rendered \"put asunder\" (see Matthew 19:6; Mark 10:9) in Christ's instruction on divorce. \"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\" Here is our heavenly Bridegroom who has vowed He will not leave us. When the devil whispers in your ear that God has abandoned you in your hour of need, remember this promise.  Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. - Hebrews 13:5",

THOUGHT  n Romans 8:35, Paul lists seven situations in which we may think we have been separated from the love of God. These are by no means exhaustive but they represent some of life's circumstances that may cause us to doubt God's love for us. In his hymn, Does Jesus Care?, Frank E. Graeff also paints for us some dark moments of life: Does Jesus care when my heart is pained Too deeply for mirth or song ... Does Jesus care when my way is dark With a nameless dread and fear ... Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed To resist some temptation strong ... Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye To the dearest on earth to me. But the refrain gives this reassurance: O yes, He cares - I know He cares! His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary, the long nights dreary, I know my Savior cares. Verse 35 begins with WHO - an interrogative pronoun of person - but Paul lists things in the answer. John Calvin points out that Paul \"preferred ascribing personality to things without life, and for this end that he might send forth with us into the contest as many champions as there are of temptations to try our faith.\" Dear child of God, we must be prepared for the struggles of this life. Here is Paul forewarning us that we will face opposition in life, from creatures and afflictions without, and doubts within - our own weakened will and strength of conviction. But the love of God will protect His true child even from their wavering faith. Our union with God is not dependent on our power. Our faith is decreed in eternity past and is forged by the power of God's own almighty hand.",

THOUGHT  he seven-item list of ordeals in Romans 8:35 is not exhaustive and except for the \"sword\" which he would soon face, Paul personally experienced these trials and afflictions. He was neither exempted from them nor immune to the anxieties that accompanied these sufferings. He wrote that as a minister of Christ, he was \"in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft ... Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches\" [2 Corinthians 11:23-28]. Tribulation carries the idea of \"being pressed\" or \"experiencing pressure\". The word is used to describe the treading of grapes to crush them. Our Lord Jesus forewarns us: \"In the world ye shall have tribulation\" [John 16:33]. Paul says to believers that \"we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God\" [Acts 14:22]. Peter says that we ought not to be surprised \"concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you\" [1 Peter 4:12]. These words ought to prepare us for what is unavoidable in the believer's life. We are called to salvation to be \"partakers of Christ's sufferings\" [1 Peter 4:13; Philippians 3:10]. What then should be our response to tribulations? Be patient (endure) [1 Peter 2:20] and rejoice [1 Peter 4:13; Colossians 1:24]. Why should we rejoice and endure? For one, our Lord Jesus has \"overcome the world\" and all its tribulations [John 16:33]. Paul adds that our present affliction is light compared to the \"far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory\" [2 Corinthians 4:17]. Tribulation is a distinguishing mark of the Christian. Paul says, \"From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus\" [Galatians 6:17].",

THOUGHT  s Paul continues with his list of ordeals, the items become more specific. Famine here does not mean an occasional lack of food; rather it is a prolonged and continual deprivation that leads to weakness. Famine is symbolic of extreme hardship. Paul said that in the course of his ministry, he was in \"weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often\" [2 Corinthians 11:27]. In the New Testament, famine is also an apocalyptic sign of distress [Matthew 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11; Revelation 6:8; 18:8]. As we approach the last day, famine will be a major concern for the world. Nakedness is also another sign of extreme hardship. It means being exposed to nature's elements - cold and heat [2 Corinthians 11:27]. Peril denotes dangers or threatening circumstances not due to one's bravado as those who engage in extreme sports. In Romans 8:35, the peril is due to a person's faith and devotion to Christ. In 2 Corinthians 11:26, Paul's reference to perils he encountered served as a rebuke to those who questioned the authenticity of his apostleship and ministry. The ultimate peril is the sword. In the New Testament, the sword can literally mean a weapon, or figuratively denote authority [Romans 13:4]. In Romans 8:35, it highlights the extreme violence believers may face. With reference to Paul, it is the executioner's sword. The lesson here is that as far as the believer is concerned, even in physical death, the separation of the soul from the body, there will be no separation of his soul from Christ. We are kept by and in Him. We are safe in His hands. I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. - John 10:28-29",

Luke informs that \"we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God\" [Acts 14:22]. Paul warns Timothy, \"all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution\" [2 Timothy 3:12]. Affliction, banishment, ostracism - these are hardly selling points for convincing sinners to follow Christ, and thus begs the question: Is it worth following Christ? Is the Christian faith good for our well-being, our marriages, and our families? The answer from testimonies of truly born-again believers has always been an emphatic \"yes\". Polycarp, when given the opportunity to recant his faith in Christ or be burnt at the stake, declared without hesitation, \"Eighty and six years I have served Him, and He has done me no wrong. How then can I blaspheme my King and Savior?\" His final words were \"I bless you, Father, for judging me worthy of this hour, so that in the company of the martyrs I may share the cup of Christ.\" Over the centuries, many faithful believers have suffered and some were put to death for their faith in Christ. The motivating factor comes down to one single point - Christ or the world? The Apostle Peter was engaged in a similar cost-benefit analysis, when he asked Jesus, \"Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?\" [Matthew 19:27]. Jesus replied, \"Every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life\" [Matthew 19:29]. It will be worth it all when we see Jesus! Life's trials will seem so small when we see Christ. One glimpse of his dear face, all sorrow will erase. So, bravely run the race till we see Christ. - Esther Kerr Rusthoi",

In the context of Paul's statement \"For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter\", it was not faithlessness that brought on the trials. Rather, it was because of their faithfulness that they were accounted as sheep for the slaughter. They suffered for Christ's sake. That begs the question we asked yesterday: Does being faithful to Christ work? Does being faithful to Christ make your life better? Some see the Christian faith as beneficial only after death. Others - those who preach a prosperity Gospel - see faith in Christ as the immediate panacea for all human sorrows; if you have enough faith, you will be happy and healthy here and now. The former surrenders the present to the devil and sees life on earth as just gritting the teeth, hanging on and waiting for heaven. The latter, on the other hand, imagines the immediate overthrow of evil and darkness. Both views are erroneous. The lens through which Paul viewed his own sufferings are expressed in his words to the Philippians, \"I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places\" (Philippians 1:12-13). Paul recognises that the blessing of the Gospel would require continual sacrifice on the part of the faithful. That is the biblical perspective on suffering. Jesus said that the man was born blind not because of his sins or his parents \"but that the works of God should be made manifest in him\" [John 9:3].",

THOUGHT  e must not presume that the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of this world can coexist. The two are diametrically opposed. There is no common ground between them. One is darkness, the other light, and there can be no communion between darkness and light as there can be no agreement between Christ and Belial, between the temple of God and idols [2 Corinthians 6:14-16]. Herod tolerated John the Baptist until he told Herod it was unlawful for him to have Herodias, his brother's wife [Matthew 14:4]. Following that, John lost his head. For the same reason, the world will suffer the truths of the Christian faith provided it does not expose their sinful folly. This is where the false idea of a \"private faith\" finds traction in the modern mindset. Believers are dissuaded from exhibiting their faith in the public domain. Christians are told not to wear their faith on their sleeves. We are mistakenly taught to take the words \"render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's\" [Matthew 22:21] to mean there must be a separation of church and state, that we are not to \"impose\" Christian values in the marketplace. The theologian Abraham Kuyper was right when he said \"there is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, 'Mine!'\" God's people must not be afraid to \"preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine\" [2 Timothy 4:2]. For it is when we keep silent lest we be killed, that we lose our usefulness for our Saviour. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. - Matthew 5:14-15",

In his own words, he said, \"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus\" [2 Corinthians 4:8-10; see also 11:23-31]. This is not even taking into account \"the care of all the churches\" [2 Corinthians 11:28] and the fact that his ministry was not always welcomed and appreciated. For Christ's sake, Paul was, in every sense of the word, \"killed all the day long\" [v. 36]. Today, instead of a steely spine and valiant faith, the present generation has a spineless spirit and a \"victimized\" mindset. Victimhood is the trump card whereby anything and everything can be an offence. Paul was \"accounted as sheep for the slaughter\" [v. 36], but he did not quit. He did not complain. He did not bemoan the sufferings he had to endure. Paul did not play the victim. On the contrary, he says, \"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not\" [2 Corinthians 11:29-31]. For Christ's sake, and by His grace, Paul was a conqueror. And so are we! \"The trying of your faith worketh patience ... Let patience have her perfect work, that (we) may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing\" [James 1:3-4].

That courageous spirit however, seems to have been lost over the years. Today, instead of standing for the truth unapologetically, we are told to give way to man's every whim and fancy. The Bible exhorts us to be courageous conquerors. The world on the other hand, tells us we should be wimpy victims. That is why phrases such as \"safe spaces\" and \"microaggressions\" have found their way into the popular lexicon and even in the church. Some Christians misinterpret what Paul says about giving none offence and pleasing all men in all things to mean that we should never upset people lest they feel victimized. The \"victim\" mentality is really a form of narcissism - self-love, self-gratification, self-righteousness, self-worship. While Paul would give none offence, he adds that he seeks not his own profit but the good of others so that they may be saved [1 Corinthians 10:32-33]. Conquerors are not self-serving, \"victims\" are. \"Victims\" demand personal rights, Christians are called to duty - to go the second mile. \"Victims\" strive to get, Christians strive to give. \"Victims\" complain \"I am offended\"; Christians say, \"I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved\".

THOUGHT  ontinuing our thoughts on the pernicious danger of victimhood, it has been rightly pointed out that the primary concern of so-called victims is their own feelings. The Westminster Confession teaches that God created man \"with reasonable and immortal souls\" (WCF, 4.2). That means that even after the fall, man is able to act reasonably, and even unbelievers \"know how to give good gifts unto (their) children\" [Luke 11:13]. However, reasonable behaviour has been replaced by subjective and capricious feelings. And feelings have become the chief concern of people in our day. Having rejected God and His Word, reasonable and sensible behaviour which are part of the renewed mind of the new creature, have been supplanted by the baser parts of man. His appetites, passions, emotions and feelings now rule. Society at large has to adapt to accommodate the feelings of easily offended self-professed victims. The Christian church has also toned down biblical truth lest we offend some. Believers are neither - as Peter says - \"natural brute beasts\" that have no understanding and who will \"utterly perish in their own corruption\" [2 Peter 2:12], nor unfeeling creatures. The Christian faith is not a cold attachment to a set of doctrines. Rather it is a faith in Christ that combines our embrace of the Son of God and our affection and trust in Him, which in turn, motivates us to live holy lives. Human emotions and feelings do not run counter to faith. Quite the contrary, faith and feelings go hand in hand. Our faith in Christ sanctifies our feelings. Therefore, being assured of His love for us, we are more than conquerors of threats from without and fears within. When we see ourselves in the light of God's Word, it becomes clear that we are not victims, but offenders against God.",

The word \"persuaded\" is also translated variously as \"trust\" [Matthew 27:43], \"have confidence in\" [Galatians 5:10; Philippians 1:6, 25; 2 Thessalonians 3:4]. In some cases, the passive verb is used [see Luke 20:6; 2 Timothy 1:5, 12]. In other instances, \"to persuade\" has the connotation of actively convincing others to believe [see 2 Corinthians 5:11]. In Romans 8:38, the word \"persuade\" is in the middle voice meaning that Paul is the agent of persuasion, and he himself was persuaded. This is an act of obedience. When Paul says \"I am persuaded,\" he is affirming his faith and confidence in God as his Saviour through Christ, and nothing and no one will be able to pluck him out of God's hand. In spite of all he had gone through, Paul, with all of his heart and mind, said, \"Lord, I have been brought to this place in my life so I am persuaded.\" What was Paul persuaded about? He was persuaded about the love of Christ being greater than everything he had faced before, than what he was facing now and what he might face in the future.

Paul is not simply teaching truth; he is stating his conviction. He is retelling us the reasons for his unwavering faith in Christ and the transformation of his life. Paul had risked his life multiple times to preach the Gospel. When thrown into the dungeon, he would have had time to rethink his position. Perhaps doubts and questions would begin to set in. Paul had to know that what he was preaching was the absolute truth if he were to remain willing to die for it and ask others to be willing to do the same. His summary statement [v. 38-39] is his response to those questions. Paul was not a naive fool. He was able to lay out the whole presentation because he relied upon those truths for his own conviction and assurance. Paul had to know that the truth he was presenting was truly the truth to know that this faith was worth dying for. We need to know that as well. We need to be as convinced of God's love as Paul was.

THOUGHT  aul was persuaded that God's love was so wonderfully glorious and insurmountable it was worth any price at any place, in any circumstance, at any time for any person. That was the strength of Paul's conviction. Also note what Paul was not persuaded about. He was not persuaded that things on this earth are going to get better. Unlike Lot who chose the plain of Jordan because \"it was well watered ... even as the garden of the LORD\" [Genesis 13:10], Paul was not persuaded that the grass somewhere else was greener. Paul never presented his persuasion as a means of improving the quality and enjoyment in this life. Paul also never said it is worth being a Christian even if the claims of Christ are false. Quite the contrary, he said that \"if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable\" [1 Corinthians 15:19]. Christians would be the biggest fools if there is no eternal reward in heaven. Paul was persuaded that \"neither death nor life ... shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord\". In the context, Paul is speaking of physical death. For the Christian, death is not separation from God but union with Him. Paul says he was \"willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord\" [2 Corinthians 5:8]. For believers, death is a joyous prospect because we will be in the presence of God. Romans 8:38 also tells us that life's physical aspects in all its attractions and detractions cannot take away our communion with God. So in death or life, and all that happens between these two terminal points, we can be assured of God's abiding and unwavering love. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. - Romans 14:8",

THOUGHT  sing a couplet, Paul bookends our life as \"things present\" and \"things to come\". With regard to \"things present\", Paul was alluding to current circumstances. In Galatians, he speaks of \"this present evil world\" [Galatians 1:4]. With regard to \"things to come\", Paul is not talking about the things to come later in his life or things in the near future. Rather, he brings us into the distant future - to eternity. This dual concept of \"things present\" and \"things to come\" is illustrated in the story of Lazarus [Luke 16:19ff]. When he was alive, Lazarus was a poor beggar, afflicted with sores. The only comfort afforded him was the dogs licking his sores, and his only desire was to eat \"the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table\" [Luke 16:20-21]. His near future brought him neither relief nor hope. But upon death, he \"was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom\" [Luke 16:22] - and eternal communion with God. The rich man also died, but he was suffering the torments of hell [Luke 16:23]. Lazarus' sufferings of things present did not separate him from the love of God, and the rich man's affluence could not bring him to God. And in things to come, the two men remained worlds apart.

As long as we live in Him, our faith will not be in vain. Neither life nor death will be an obstacle to God's love. The love of God in Christ will overcome angels, principalities, powers and any other creature. In the context, the \"angels\" would be the fallen angels who tempt us to depart from God. In the Bible, the devil and his demons are given power to afflict believers. Case in point: Job. \"Principalities\" are the civil authorities who have power to hinder our devotion to God [see Daniel 6ff; Acts 4:1819]. \"Powers\" allude to the false teachers who have the ability of working miracles to deceive many. \"Creatures\" encompass the whole spectrum of created beings that oppose God and try to break the communion between believers and God. All these cannot separate a person from Christ, no matter what powers they may possess. They will fail because Christ is supreme over these things. For the days we have on earth, things may get worse, but no matter what, God's promise will not fail and believers will never be separated from the love of God because \"greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world\" [1 John 4:4].

This discourse will run for three chapters (Romans 9-11). They are sometimes described as a parenthesis because they seem unrelated to the preceding chapters. These three chapters have also sparked much debate amongst believers whether the church is the Israel of God. The Old Testament is unequivocally clear that the Jews were God's chosen people. Moses writes: \"For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth [Deuteronomy 7:68]. God promised to bless them and to bless all nations through them. But they rejected Christ. \"He came unto his own, and his own received him not\" [John 1:11]. In light of the Jews' rejection of Christ, did God's purpose to bless the Jews fail? And, if God's purpose for the Jews failed, what assurance do we have that His promise and purpose to save us will succeed? In other words, how do we know that nothing will separate us as His chosen people from His love in Christ? The simple answer is NO; God's plan will never fail. God has delivered His people in the past. He continues to preserve His people in the present, and He will restore the nation of Israel in the days to come. This truth is just as applicable to the nation as it is to the person. God is not done with you. His plan is still on track, and His plan will be fulfilled precisely as He has always intended.",

THOUGHT  o prove that God is faithful in keeping His promises we need to know a few things. Firstly, what is God's covenant promise to Israel through Abraham? From Romans 1:1-3 we know it is \"the gospel of God (which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh\". This means that God's covenant with His people Israel through Abraham was made by His election grace and would be accomplished in His Son Jesus Christ, the greater Son of David. Secondly, in chapters 9-11 Paul emphasized God's faithfulness to keep His Word to save the believing remnant of Abraham's descendants in spite of Israel's unbelief. This is crucial because if God had justifiably given up on Israel because of their unfaithfulness, how can Gentile believers be certain of God's faithfulness to keep His promises to them regarding their salvation in Christ? The answer is in God's faithfulness in spite of Israel's unfaithfulness. Thirdly, our Christian hope in the return of our Lord Jesus is inseparable from and premised upon God's faithfulness in keeping His covenant promise to Abraham. Romans 11:26: \"And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob\". God is faithful in keeping His promises. \"Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations\" [Deuteronomy 7:9].

Did not the Scriptures teach to \"let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay\" [James 5:12b]. Indeed. That said, Paul found it extremely difficult coming to terms with his fellow Jews being without Christ. In verse 2, Paul lamented \"I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.\" Paul knew that the Jews were without Christ - they had rejected Him. But why would they be so steeped in unbelief to reject their Messiah? They were greatly privileged to be custodians of the Truth. God by His grace set them apart for Himself as a special people so that they might worship Him and bear witness of Him to all the earth. Israel was given the Law and Temple services, and promises of the Scriptures so that all peoples through them might know the One True Holy Living God. But instead of serving the Lord in humility and proclaiming Him, Israel put themselves above others. Blinded by their pride, they rejected Christ. Consequently, unbelieving Jews without Christ are as lost as unsaved Gentiles. They would suffer God's judgment and that brought great sorrow to Paul because the Gospel had come through the Jews. Think about that. The Lord Jesus, fully God and fully man but sinless, was a Jew by birth. He came to His own but His own received Him not. But we, who are non-Jews, have received by grace, salvation in Christ. How do we show our gratitude to the Lord? We pray for sinners to be convicted of their sins and turn to Christ as we proclaim the Gospel to all, including the Jews.

So great was his love for his brethren in the flesh that he lamented their pride and unbelief. In retrospect, Paul would have recalled the hardness of his own heart against Christ and the believers. Back then, Paul was an enemy of Christ. He was \"a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief \" [1 Timothy 1:13]. By God's grace, Paul was marvellously saved. Even though Paul saw himself to be the chief of sinners, he also knew God's mercy and grace were able to save even the worst of sinners. This reminds us that before we were saved by grace, we were enemies of God. We may not have murdered anyone literally but we have sinned in our hearts, minds and deeds. God's Word in Romans 5 describes us as ungodly [v. 6], sinners [v. 8] and enemies [v. 10]. There is absolutely no way we can get out of God's condemnation and holy wrath which we deserve. \"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him\" [Romans 5:8-9]. This wondrous truth should not only humble us to praise God for His mercies but also move us to have compassion for the unsaved. Can we hide our love and gratitude to God for His saving Grace and not share the Good News to win them to Christ? Of course not!

His zeal and love for his countrymen were so strong that he was willing to be accursed in order that they might be saved. The word \"accursed\" is translated from the Greek word anathema, which means \"destroyed\". The words \"I could wish\" means Paul had the desire to be accursed for his brethren's sake and he wished he could. He was wishing it sincerely but knew he could not accomplish what he was wishing for. This is because theologically and doctrinally nothing was able to separate him from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord [Romans 8:38-39]. The point is that despite what his own people did, even in trying to kill him, Paul desired their salvation. No matter the cost, he was willing \"to be cursed\" by God for his brethren's sake so that they might know Christ. You can tell the great internal conflict Paul was struggling with. How about us? Having received so great a salvation in Christ, do we not feel like Paul, for the salvation of our loved ones? Are we not crying out to God to save our parents, siblings, and grandparents who are still idol worshippers? Indeed, we do and must. Every time we talk to them about Christ, we pray that our unsaved loved ones will respond to the Gospel and be saved. But if they remain hardened we would experience a measure of the conflict Paul went through for his fellow Jews.  While it is impossible to exchange one's soul to save another, Paul's willingness to be destroyed for the sake of Israel's salvation demonstrates the power of Christ's constraining love.",

While Moses was up on Mount Sinai receiving the Commandments from the Lord, the people below very quickly turned and made themselves a golden calf to worship. Exodus 32:31-32 tells us, \"And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.\" Filled with righteous anger Moses confessed that the people committed a great sin by worshipping an idol. Yet despite the seriousness of their sin, Moses pleaded with the Lord for their forgiveness. If the Lord would not relent, Moses asked that he be blotted out in order that they might be spared. Moses was willing to stand in the gap between the people and God's wrath if it could avert God's just punishment. Such was Moses' love for God's people. May God give us a heart like Moses to put ourselves on the line for sinners undeserving of God's mercies. May we practise the love of Moses and Paul for God's people by looking to the example and sacrifice of One Greater, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd of His sheep. Only He by His Spirit will enable us to love sinners selflessly even though they are undeserving as we once were. May the love of God through us lead many to Christ.

God had sovereignly chosen Abraham to be the one through whom a nation would be raised to be a witness for Him. They would be the descendants of Abraham. They would be given a law and a land. These three elements - people, law and land - were specific. Abraham had eight sons, but the God-chosen line was through Abraham's son of promise with Sarah, Isaac, and from Isaac's son, Jacob. In Genesis 32:28, we are further told that after his struggle with God at Peniel, Jacob's name was changed to Israel - a \"prince who has prevailed with God\" - to reflect his new status in God's eyes. The Israelites (also called Hebrews and later on Jews) are the people of this covenantal line, through Jacob's twelve sons. Because of a great famine, Jacob's family of seventy [Genesis 46:27] moved to Egypt under the auspices of Joseph who had become the second ruler after Pharaoh. But as time passed and pharaohs changed, the Hebrews, who were many in number, came to be perceived as a threat by the Egyptians and were enslaved. According to divine timetable, God acted and the exodus under Moses would lead His chosen people to their eventual occupation of the promised land Canaan. The number of Hebrew men above twenty years old leaving Egypt was about 600,000. Including women and children, it is estimated that the population would number about two million. God had promised to make of Abraham a great nation. Their beginnings were insignificant but against all human odds, what the Almighty God promised, He fulfilled. These were the Israelites and they were God's \"special treasure\".

To be adopted is to be conferred a status which one was not hitherto entitled. To be adopted into sonship is to inherit and become a beneficiary of all that the father owns - His blessings now and hereafter. To the Israelites was also granted the special blessing of God's \"shekinah\" glory manifesting His divine presence with them. In their exodus from Egypt, God's \"shekinah\" dwelt with them in the Ark of the Covenant within the Tabernacle. In the Promised Land, God would dwell with them in the Temple that Solomon built. But sinful as mankind were, Israel would depart from God's way and transgress His law time and time again only to be disciplined as by a loving father [Hebrews 12:6-8], and restored according to God's covenant with Abraham and His special relationship with His chosen people. Fast forward to the time of Paul and to our day, the promised Son of David has come and the way of salvation to Gentiles is open through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

The Mosaic covenant initiated and developed their growth as a nation. They were given a codified law to order their lives for their benefit. They would learn the consequences of faithlessness and the blessings of faithfulness. The Davidic covenant would establish God's promise to Israel's king and his posterity of an eternal kingdom through a promised future Son of his line. The Law given at Sinai was the sign of God's divine rule over them. It covered all aspects of Israelite life - moral, civil and ceremonial. Obedience would result in His approval and blessing. Disobedience would incur His displeasure and chastisement. The Law was for their good. God was the originator of all His covenants. Only He could fulfil them. Other than the Mosaic covenant which required Israel's compliance, these were \"unconditional\" covenants because God made them, and He alone would keep His promises. Christians today are the beneficiaries of these covenants because what God gave to the Jews at the outset, He has given to us because of their rejection of His Son [Romans 11:11]. Our lives are ordered by God's moral Law. We are saved because He sent His Son in fulfilment of His covenant with David, which leads to His establishment of the New Covenant whereby His Law is written in our hearts, and every person, Jew or Gentile, who calls upon Jesus the Saviour in faith for forgiveness, will receive His saving grace and eternal life. The New Covenant: \"But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.\" [Jeremiah 31:33]",

This Law originated from God, and it would differentiate them from the idol-worshipping nations around them. Worship carried out correctly would give reverence to God who set His love upon them and chose them not because they were great or righteous. Worshipping in obedience would glorify the Giver. The Israelites were given the singular honour of being the people by which God's great salvation plan for mankind would unfold. The promise to Abraham of being the father of many nations centred around the Hebrew people. The greatest promise of the coming Jewish Messiah, who would bring eternal life and usher in an eternal kingdom, would be fulfilled through the line of David of the tribe of Judah [Revelation 5:5]. Jerusalem, the city in the land promised according to God's covenant with the Israelites, will be the centre of God's dominion on earth in the future millennial kingdom. Christians today have the privilege of service and the benefits of God's promises. We are saved by faith in the risen Son of David. Our worship and service reflect our love and desire to obey Him. We worship not in lip-service, external rituals and merit-seeking gestures but by submission to Him in obedience. To obey is greater than sacrifice [1 Samuel 15:22].

Some even attend Christian schools where they receive sound Christian education. What should our response be?

He warned them not to presume that just because they were the descendants of Abraham, they could \"flee from the wrath to come\" [Matthew 3:7], that they would automatically qualify for citizenship in the Messiah's kingdom. Many of the Jews, including those of our day, believe that circumcision plus perhaps the confession of the creed of Israel \"the LORD our God is one LORD\" [Deuteronomy 6:4], would be enough to ensure their admission into the \"bosom\" of Abraham because Abraham's righteousness would be reckoned as theirs. John told them that they needed to \"bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance\" [Matthew 3:8]. Indeed, many Christians have the same erroneous concept of salvation. They think that because they were born to godly parents, baptized as infants and grew up in Christian homes, they are saved. The Bible, especially in the Book of Romans, clearly teaches that this is not so. Only those who truly repent of their sins and receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour are saved.

The man they had crucified for being so audacious in claiming to be God, is in fact \"the very God\". This is consistent with what Paul teaches in many of his epistles; for example, in Philippians 2:10-11, \"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow ... And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\" Secondly, the deity of Christ is taught in many other parts of the Bible. For example, in Matthew 1, the angel Gabriel informed Joseph that the birth of his son was a fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy, and \"they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us\" [Matthew 1:23]. Likewise, the Gospel of John is basically about the deity of Christ. Thus, we can confidently pronounce, Jesus Christ, \"Who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.\" In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. - John 1:1",

THOUGHT  ld Testament prophecies of the Messiah often hint of His dual nature. A good example is Isaiah 9:6 which we often quote at Christmas; \"Unto us a child is born\" speaks of the human nature of this man who would be born to human parents. \"Unto us a son is given\" attests to His identity as the Son of God proclaimed in another well-known Bible verse: John 3:16. Hence what Paul states here in Romans 9:5 is entirely consistent with the teachings of the Scriptures. The mystery of the human-divine nature of Christ is beyond our finite understanding, but it is central to our Christian faith. It also holds the key to our salvation. The Son of God had to take on human form in order to be able to die for our sins. As a man, He was subject to His parents in His youth, engaged in the carpenter's trade, ate and slept like other men and was subject to suffering and finally death, like all others. As a man, He was \"in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\" [Hebrews 4:15]. What sets Jesus Christ apart from all the other religious leaders of the world is that He is, in the words of the Westminster Confession of Faith, \"very God, and very man, yet one Christ, the only Mediator between God and man\"; which means that \"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" [Acts 4:12].  Do not be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; \"For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth\" [Roman 1:16].",

This promise was to Israel and yet Israel rejected God. However, this did not abrogate God's promise. Paul explains that God's promise was not meant to be fulfilled in ALL the descendants of Abraham but only in those whose hearts are touched by His grace, who rest their trust in Him and seek to obey His will. These are the \"spiritual children\" of Abraham who constitute \"spiritual Israel\". Conversely those who reject (disbelieve) God and His Son are not and belong to \"natural Israel\". The lineage of Abraham, external ceremonies and circumcision do not gain salvation. It requires the circumcision of the heart, which corresponds to an inward transformation [Romans 2:28-29]. \"Natural Israel\", which is the vast majority, rebelled against God and His appointed servants. They rebelled against Moses and were slain by God in the wilderness. They killed the prophets God sent to warn them. Except for a faithful remnant, the nation as a whole became apostate and deserving of God's judgment. The Northern Kingdom was overthrown by the Assyrians in 722 BC and the Southern Kingdom destroyed by Babylonians in 586 BC. When our Lord Jesus, God Incarnate, went to them, the nation had little faith. They rejected His teachings and denied their promised Messiah. In their cruel hatred, they crucified Him. Blinded by Satan, \"natural Israel\" put to death their Saviour whom God had promised their father Abraham. Sadly, today, secular Israel is \"natural Israel\". To day if ye will hear his voice, Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness: When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. - Psalm 95:7b-9",

The great majority of Jews, led by their religious leaders, mistakenly believed that receiving the Law, the promises of God, temple worship, ceremonies and circumcision would automatically make them God's children. But those divine privileges and advantages in themselves did not bring salvation. Paul's answer is that only believing faith in Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, accepting that He died a substitutionary death for our sins and imputed His righteousness upon us will save [2 Corinthians 5:21]. The \"spiritual Israel\" of the Old Testament believed God and His promises, and looked forward to the coming of the promised Messiah in Christ Jesus whom they had neither seen nor knew [Hebrews 11:1]. Abraham was an example of such faith [Romans 4]. He was declared righteous by God [Genesis 15:6] even before he was circumcised [Genesis 17] and before the giving of the Law to Moses, which was 400 years later [Exodus 16]. Even so, Abraham would not have been able to keep the Law for it would only condemn the lawbreaker and bring upon him God's wrath. It was Abraham's faith in God that made him a \"spiritual Israelite\". Abraham is the spiritual father to all who, like him, are called and in faith believe in God \"who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were\" [Romans 4:16-17]. God honours people of such faith throughout the history of \"spiritual Israel\" [Hebrews 11]. The \"spiritual Israel\" of the New Testament looks back in time, believing on the Saviour Jesus Christ, His finished work of salvation on Calvary's cross for repentant sinners and looking forward to His glorious return soon. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name. - John 1:12",

If their hearts remain untouched by the Gospel and their lives unchanged, they are merely \"cultural Christians\". Ancient Antioch was known for its immorality. God raised a group of genuine believers who were so enamoured by Christ they followed Him closely, manifested His teachings and character. The pagans called them Christ's ones or \"Christians\" because they were distinct from others in their society. Genuine Christians are those whose hearts have been touched by the Gospel, convicted by the Holy Spirit and ... 1.

He illustrated this through the examples of the patriarchs, beginning with Abraham and his son, Isaac. Firstly, God chose Abraham while he was living in idolatry in Ur of the Chaldees and Abraham in complete faith obeyed God's call. Of Abraham's sons, only Isaac, the son born to Sarah in her old age, and his seed would be blessed through God's covenant with Abraham [Genesis 17:19, 21]. Isaac was the only son born out of a promise given by God, through supernatural means to a father and mother too advanced in age to have children naturally. Neither Ishmael, born of Sarah's Egyptian handmaid Hagar, nor any of the six sons Abraham had with his concubine Keturah were part of this blessed line [Genesis 25:1-2]. Although they were the seed of Abraham, they were not the spiritual seed God had promised him. We were chosen by God even while we were living in sin, with nothing good in us to merit salvation. We were spiritually reborn by divine means when it seemed hopeless and impossible for our hearts to be regenerated. Our election and salvation cannot be justified and explained by human logic and reasoning. God brought us into His fold and saved us from our sin because of His love for us. Thank God for His marvellous grace and bounteous mercy that drew us to Him with cords of love.

The Apostle Paul debunks this misconception with the example of Jacob and Esau, the twin sons of Isaac and his wife, Rebekah. Scripture tells us that only Jacob was chosen by God even before the boys' birth [Genesis 25:23]. The events in Jacob's life bore evidence of God's preservation and blessing. God even changed Jacob's name to Israel and promised him great blessings [Genesis 35:10-12]. Indeed the 12 tribes of Israel were the offspring of his sons and grandsons. The priestly line originated from Levi, while the prophets sent by God to preach repentance to Israel and the surrounding nations came from the twelve tribes. Our Lord Jesus, the Promised Messiah, was from the tribe of Judah. These are all assurances that the seed of Jacob was the children promised by God. God's election of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, demonstrates that He elects whom He wills to be His holy seed. They responded in faith and received salvation. The Jews failed to understand the true meaning of God's promises to them. They took pride in being Abraham's seed, thinking they were the children of God but rejected the Messiah sent from God. Jesus identified them as children of the devil [John 8:44] for refusing to believe the Gospel message He brought them. This is a solemn warning to all. If we reject Jesus as our Saviour who takes away our sin, God will not recognize us as His.

The Jews boasted of being Abraham's children, but Jesus told them plainly that mere physical descent did not make one a child of God [John 8:32-40]. They were Abraham's physical descendants but did not display the same saving faith as Abraham. Their denial of Jesus as the Son of God and rejection of the salvation He offered meant they remained servants of sin. Paul emphasizes that there is a distinction between the physical nation of Israel and the spiritual people of God. Salvation comes upon the chosen spiritual children of God. They hear the Gospel, respond in faith believing that the Lord Jesus will cleanse them of their sins, and give their lives to obey Him. The vast majority of Jews past and present do not believe that Jesus is the Messiah sent from God to save mankind despite the religious education they have since childhood. In the early church and even till today, new Christian converts are overwhelmingly Gentiles. Dear reader, do you believe God's promise to save us through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ? Let us not be deceived into thinking that our birth into a Christian family, our attendance in church or Sunday School will earn us any spiritual privileges. Every one of us is individually accountable to God and must demonstrate personal faith. We will not be saved if we harbour unbelief and refuse to place our faith in the Saviour.

The promise made to Abraham and Sarah seemed humanly impossible for they were old, and Sarah had been barren for many years. Yet God repeatedly declared to Abraham that He would bless him and Sarah in His appointed time [Genesis 18:14]. This was fulfilled in the conception and birth of Isaac. The strength of a promise and the likelihood of it being fulfilled depends entirely on the person making the promise. If the person is trustworthy, he will be sincere and intend to fulfil his promise. However, if he is sincere but powerless, the promise is still empty. Likewise, if a person is deceitful and cannot be trusted, even though he may be powerful, the promise made will be unfulfilled as well.

If God's love of Jacob consists in His choosing Jacob to be the seed who would inherit the blessings promised to Abraham, then God's hatred of Esau is best understood to refer to God's decision not to bestow this privilege on Esau. It might be better rendered \"reject\". Here, \"love\" and \"hate\" are not emotions that God feels but actions that He carries out. God's action is to bestow His salvation on those He chooses, which is the traditional Calvinistic interpretation of God's election. The issue which troubles many is how God, who is described as a God of love, can withhold His love in action, or election from some, and hate (reject) them. They should rather be asking themselves why God should love them in the first place. In the many generations following Jacob, it was revealed to the Israelites that God's choice to bestow His love upon them was not due to anything found in them, not on the grounds of some intrinsic goodness, some greater intelligence, some moral superiority, or some military prowess, but solely in the love found in God Himself.  The LORD did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: But because the LORD loved you. - Deuteronomy 7:7-8a",

THOUGHT  od's election of Jacob to be the recipient of the seed which would inherit the blessings promised to Abraham did not originate in Jacob. Neither did God compare Jacob to Esau and determined that Jacob had greater potential to do good. The choice had nothing to do with the actual good or the potential good, the actual or potential evil, of Jacob and Esau. Neither did God look down the corridors of time to see whether Jacob or Esau would respond in faith and therefore chose one. This false teaching is the Arminian position where faith becomes the basis for God's choice. Election has to do with the purpose of God. It is of His sovereign good pleasure. Election is intertwined with the sovereignty of God. In a broad sense, God decides to do whatever He desires, without pressure or constraint from any outside influence. And ever since the creation, God has sovereignly prescribed or permitted everything in human history, in order that He might accomplish the redemptive plan which He had previously designed to \"accomplish that which (He) please(s)\" [Isaiah 55:11]. God chooses whomever He chooses, for reasons that are wholly His. This is evident in John 15:16 where Jesus told His disciples, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you\". In 1 Timothy 5:21 this is reflected in God's choice of his \"elect angels\". And this again demonstrates that God has \"chosen us in Him (Jesus) before the foundation of the world\" [Ephesians 1:4].  God does not choose us because we believe, but that we may believe. - Augustine",

THOUGHT  nce again, God did not look in the future to see whether Esau would reject God's call to faith and then to act upon that knowledge. God's election of Jacob for eternal salvation and the passing over of Esau originate from His eternal counsels, the latter of which is called reprobation. Although both election and reprobation follow from the will of God, there is a difference between the two. In election, God regenerates the heart, and this precedes faith. More precisely, regeneration is the cause of faith. In the doctrine of reprobation, those who are lost are not made to disbelief by God. Rather, God chooses to withhold the grace of regeneration. The heart of stone remains as stone in such an unbeliever and as a result, the reprobate does not come to faith of his own accord. And since such a one is still burdened by the punishment for sin as they do not have their sins forgiven, God judges them according to the strict standards of divine justice. This is most clearly evident in the hardening of Pharoah's heart in Exodus. First references are to God's hardening of Pharaoh's heart. God has eternally decreed to refrain from extending saving grace to Pharaoh. This is then followed by Pharaoh's own self-hardening. Without a renewed heart, there will be deliberate disobedience to God's will. Even in the doctrine of reprobation, God demonstrates that He is absolutely sovereign. Even the reprobate is subject to Him.  Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. - Romans 9:18",

THOUGHT  he answer to the first question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism tells us that \"Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever.\" It should be noted that all men, elect and reprobate, glorify God. In the doctrine of election, the glory of His free love and bountiful grace bestowed upon God's elect is on full display at the cross. In the doctrine of reprobation, the passing over of some to dishonour and wrath for their sin displays the glory of God's justice and righteousness. And when these two doctrines are considered side by side, where all men do not deserve His salvation grace but rather deserve eternal condemnation, the doctrine of reprobation magnifies the divine mercy and love of God. These two doctrines demonstrate that God's absolute rule and control is maintained and cannot be overturned or overcome by man's will or circumstances. By extension, this implies that whatever God has decreed before the foundation of the world will come to pass. We can have great confidence that those whom God did predestinate are those whom He called; and those that He called will be justified and thereafter glorified [Romans 8:30]. God does not begin a work He does not finish. May we trust in God's promise that \"if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins\" [1 John 1:9]. Let us reflect upon the words in this familiar hymn: Amazing grace how sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found, Was blind but now I see. (John Newton) But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. - 1 Corinthians 15:10",

We want to treat others fairly, and in return, we want to be treated fairly. And we also want God to be fair to us! In Romans 9:14, Paul is anticipating what he knew many would ask about his words in the preceding verse; that God loved Jacob and hated Esau. Does God's favour upon Jacob and not Esau mean that God was unrighteous? Paul's answer was an emphatic no. \"God forbid\" literally means \"May it never be!\" The exclamatory phrase suggests that Paul regards the question as outrageous. By virtue of who He is, God cannot possibly be unjust [Genesis 18:25]. John Calvin writes: \"Monstrous surely is the madness of the human mind, that it is more disposed to charge God with unrighteousness than to blame (himself) for blindness.\" Another commentator points out that if God were to save all on account of who they are and what they have done - faith, good works - that would also be inherently unfair because their backgrounds and upbringing are not equal. Some owing to their natural temperament or their being raised in a believing family, may find it easier to be more trusting. For the same reasons, it is easier for some to be good and moral people. Others, being raised in violent, immoral or heathen backgrounds, would be more inclined to sin and rebellion. Hence, if God's election is based on a sinner's deeds, that would be unfair. The greatest act of injustice is Christ dying for our sins \"the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God\" [1 Peter 3:18]. Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will He teach sinners in the way. - Psalm 25:8",

The question is: can we legitimately claim God has violated our rights? The answer is again an emphatic no. We have sinned against God. We have trampled on the Almighty and His holy law. Fairness and justice would mean that He must give us what we deserve - death. \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die\" [Ezekiel 18:4, 20]. \"The wages of sin is death\" [Romans 6:23]. To get what we deserve is perfect justice, and we have no grounds to accuse God of being unjust if He does not grant us mercy and salvation. Christ illustrates this truth in a parable in Matthew 20:1-16. A landowner went into the marketplace in the morning and hired workers for his vineyard. The agreed wage was one penny for the day's work. At different times of the day, the landowner returned and hired more workers, agreeing to pay them whatever was right. At the end of the day, the landowner paid the earliest group one penny. The workers who worked for just an hour were also paid one penny. That sparked cries of unfairness from those who had worked the whole day. The landowner said to them, \"Didst not thou agree with me for a penny? ... Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?\" [Matthew 20:13-15]. The landowner was fair when he gave the first group of workers what they had agreed. He was gracious to the last group. All sinners deserve God's wrath. There is no unfairness on God's part. The elect receive God's grace, which is His to dispense.

This is a good question - if it is not just for theoretical debate. Many have asked this with genuine desire to know who God is. Firstly, we should realise that fairness is not a matter of God's mercy, but rather a question about His justice. Is it just for God to show mercy to some, and not to others? The answer is - if God was to be just according to His holy standard, then all of us are bound for destruction and hell. Yet God has chosen some to be saved despite who we are, for reasons He has not revealed to anyone. Why did God save some, and pass by others? It is certainly not a matter of merit. Those whom God regenerates might be the worst of sinners, yet when God's grace comes upon them, it is irresistible. The truth is God does not owe us an answer. Romans 9:15 tells us clearly that He the sovereign God who creates, also determines. Those whom God saved despite their sinfulness ought to be grateful for His mercies, and seek to extend the good news of salvation to others, so that they can also enjoy His saving grace. How does knowing this help us understand God's attributes then? Both His justice and His mercy tell of His glory. God, in punishing sinners, displays His power, omniscience and justice. Yet by His sovereign prerogative and determination, He has given sinful humankind the way of escape, which in turn demonstrates His love and grace. Through both reprobation of sinners and election of the saved, God's name is glorified.  For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. - Habakkuk 2:14",

If we were to think more deeply, the difference between these two words will offer much insight on our condition and God's love for us. To the believer, \"mercy\" tells about the despairing situation we were once in. We were once condemned and destined for hell, but God had mercy and pardoned our transgressions by taking on the punishment upon Himself. \"Grace\", on the other hand, is God bestowing upon us the merits we do not deserve. God has absolutely no obligation to bestow upon us His righteousness and blessings, yet He has out of the abundance of His grace. In short, \"mercy\" is God withholding from us the punishment and judgment that we deserve, and \"grace\" is God bestowing upon us the gifts and blessings that we do not deserve. To the non-believer, God's mercies and grace are also apparent and new every morning. It is by His mercies that this sinful world still stands, and that sinners are not consumed by His anger against sin. Instead, God added His grace upon His mercy by sustaining the world (in theological terms called common grace) and extending the offer of salvation (saving grace) to anyone who will believe. \"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance\" [2 Peter 3:9]. Believers or not, let us not take God's mercies for granted. Neither should we frustrate His grace toward us. Come, know the Lord. Then thank Him for His mercy and cherish every day to sing of His goodness. Praise God for His grace and use every moment to be a channel of blessing to others.

He wanted assurance from God that He would be with them [Exodus 33:15], even asking God to show him His glory [Exodus 33:18]. To this request, God had answered, \"I will make all My goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.\" God was merciful and gracious towards Moses not because Moses was good in his own righteousness, but God revealed His goodness to one whom He chose. This is the same in the deliverance of Israel from their Egyptian bondage. God had rained plague after plague upon Egypt so that Pharaoh would eventually let the Israelites go. The final plague was the hardest strike on Egypt and the false gods they worshipped. The Egyptian idols were proven useless in protecting their patrons in the disasters, and now even their firstborn were taken. On the other hand, the Israelites who had their doorposts smeared with blood from the lamb were passed over in this final plague. God had mercy upon the Israelites not because there was something inherently deserving in them, for if any had decided not to follow God's instructions and go through the plague without the blood of the lamb, their firstborn would surely have been killed as well. The truth is that God graciously worked faith in the hearts of the believing ones, and salvation was only possible by faith through the blood.

THOUGHT  et us consider further the Old Testament origins of this passage, Exodus 33:19. The Israelites had witnessed great miracles from God - from the ten plagues to the parting of the Red Sea. They experienced the provision of manna every day but one in the week, and yet when Moses was up on Mount Sinai receiving God's instructions, they allowed their imaginations to run wild and made a golden calf to worship. For this great sin, they suffered punishment and three thousand perished. We then read in Exodus 32:31-32 that Moses made an unusual request: \"And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.\" Moses was willing to suffer eternal punishment on behalf of the people. The psalmist records: \"Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them\" [Psalm 106:23]. Moses with his limited knowledge did not know that this was impossible. No sinful mortal can suffer God's wrath vicariously for another - no matter how willing he was. We can only pay for our own sins. This points us to the One who could die in propitiation for all our sins - the Lord Jesus Christ. \"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him\" [2 Corinthians 5:21]. Moses was able to plead on behalf of his people, but only the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the very God Himself, can save us from our unrighteousness.

Firstly, we should realise we need mercy. The fact that we need God's pardon might sound unpalatable to the natural man who has confidence in his own ways. Brought up in a world that focuses on man's own wisdom and strength, it is difficult for such a person to realise that man at his best is nothing without God and bound for hell. Solely by God's grace does His Spirit work in us, so that our hearts are softened to understand our condition. Next, we should call upon God for mercy. Sometimes God allows circumstances in life to bring us to our knees, and if this is the case, thank God for giving us this opportunity to walk closer with Him. Better a temporal pain here and now than the eternal suffering of hell. \"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.\" [Jeremiah 29:11-13] Finally, we need to tell others of God's mercy. It is true that God has chosen those whom He will have compassion on, but the counsel of God also tells us He works through unworthy vessels, which we are, to spread the Gospel. Understanding God's mercy to us must cause us to be merciful to others, and through our actions and deeds, tell others about His saving grace.

THOUGHT  t is notable that even though the Bible was not yet written in the time that the Israelites were slaves in Egypt, Paul chooses to use the phrase \"The Scripture saith\". Cross-referencing Exodus 9:13-16, we see that Romans 9:17 is Paul quoting what God had said to Pharaoh through Moses His servant. This gives us some insight into the mind of Paul and how he regarded Scripture. For Paul, there was no difference between what \"God saith\" and \"the Scripture saith\". Indeed, we all regard the Bible as the Word of God. Yet, oftentimes we may not live in a manner that demonstrates this. Let us examine ourselves and reflect on the following. First, do we enjoy reading the Bible or find it a chore? Dear Christian, if we profess to be God's children who love Him, then we should derive utmost enjoyment from hearing our Father's voice speaking to us from the pages of His Word. Second, how do we deal with difficult passages in the Bible? Romans 9:17-18 teaches a truth some may find difficult to swallow. We readily accept verses which speak of the mercy and grace of God. However, Paul here emphasises the point that God's raising of Pharaoh, only to harden his heart was also for God's glory. Yes, the hardening of one's heart may also be an act of God's judgment. It is vital that we do not fall into the trap of allowing our biases to distort our understanding of how God works. Let us not downplay what He says.  Am I picking and choosing what parts of the Bible to believe?",

As the Sovereign Creator, He has the freedom to save whom He would and to judge those He would. When we consider the purposes of evangelism, we often think the reason we evangelize is to help point others to God through Christ so that souls may be saved. That is not wrong. However, we must also remember that there is an even higher purpose to evangelism. Just as all creation was brought into being to glorify God, the ultimate goal of evangelism is similarly to glorify God. God's sovereignty is glorified during evangelism whether or not the listener professes a desire to receive Christ. Just as God was glorified through the awesome display of His power each time Pharaoh hardened his heart, He will also be glorified when the time for all mankind to be judged comes, even through those who have hardened their hearts. Salvation is entirely God's gift. Let us respond in grateful adoration to Him. As Christians, we glorify God by remembering our entire dependency on Him. We consider our sinfulness, and how Christ loves us and continues to intercede for us in heaven. This must produce a thankful heart that constantly gives praise and glory to God as well as motivate us to live a life well-pleasing to Him.

Ironically, many such individuals will then go on to profess that it is precisely because of this perceived \"unfairness\" that they choose not to believe in Him, sealing their eternal fates even though the solution had been presented to them. Let us consider the idea of \"finding fault\". We seek to assign blame when we feel we are the wronged party. This is why many unbelievers are quick to blame God for allowing the existence of suffering in this world. However, can we really consider ourselves as being \"wronged\"? Let us realise that in God's eyes, we are all sinners who deserve punishment. Any calamity that befalls us is therefore fitting punishment. Even if there are hardcore atheists who do not accept God's Word as the standard for their living and therefore claim they do not deserve the pain of suffering, they are still guilty on account of their own self-destructive tendencies. They often fail their own standards of morality and engage in activities that harm their own body (example: illicit sex, overeating, drinking, smoking, etc). How can they then claim it is God's obligation to take better care of them than they are taking care of themselves?  It is self-pity to blame God for the consequences of my own sinful nature.",

THOUGHT  imilar to yesterday's discussion on finding fault with God, many individuals argue for diminished responsibility for their sins on the grounds of God's will. They claim God had willed them to sin and since the creature has no power to go against the Creator's will, there is therefore no way for them to avoid their sins. The extreme version of this argument extends to salvation itself - if God has elected them to destruction, how then can they be blamed for choosing not to believe in God? The answer to such a statement is the same - stop looking at yourself as an innocent party. It would be unjust for a just and holy God to condemn a sinless man to eternal damnation. Because none are sinless, God is therefore just to condemn sinners. When we have such discussions with unbelievers, it often becomes academic at this point and winning the highly theoretical argument here is very unlikely to turn the unsaved person to Christ. Instead, take a more practical approach to provide more salvation opportunities and help the unsaved person acknowledge his own sinful and self-destructive nature. Instead of trying to dictate what God should and should not be doing for all individuals, will the person believe in Christ himself/herself ? By refusing and resisting God's will for him/her to be saved, the unbeliever may realise his own self-destructive nature because though they were offered a way out, they chose not to take it. Yet, and more personally, think of how we got to know Christ - how God worked miraculously in our lives to turn us from our sinful ways. We are who we are only by God's grace. Ask God for patience in doing His works in His ways. It is pride to want to dictate how God should act to save sinners.",

Sinners can never comprehend the doctrine of election. Romans 9:20 provides the answer. Election is God's sovereign choice to save those He elects in His mercy, not by their merit nor any work of man. The words \"O man\" contrast you and me, the creatures, with God, the creator of all things. Who are we to talk back to God who created us? Apostle Paul intends to put us in our proper place as it is ridiculous for finite man to comprehend and question the infinite God. He rebukes those who do so as being rebellious, arrogant and stubborn. They are not in any position to question God's sovereign acts nor able to understand God's eternal perspective. God is not obligated to tell us what He is doing, whom He chooses to save, and how He decides on things. In fact, our finite minds will never be able to comprehend, \"for My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the LORD.\" [Isaiah 55:8]. God only requires us to obey and trust Him. He desires that we submit to and love Him with all our heart, soul and mind. Rather than questioning God's will for our lives, we should shift our perspective to living life every day according to His revealed will for us in order to please Him. May God help us to centre our thoughts and actions around Him. I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.

God reserves the right to show mercy to some and not others. But Paul reminds us here that whoever objects to God's sovereignty is a fool. As sinners, we do not deserve God's mercy or grace. We are subject to God's power and wrath, and ultimately will face eternal death if we do not repent and turn to Him. God, the creator of the universe, has always been merciful and loving. We cannot see the whole of God's plan but we know God is love [1 John 4:8]. We know God cares for us [Isaiah 44:2], that \"the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb will help thee\".

        "part7": "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  PRAYER  Hath not the potter power over the clay?\" Here, the apostle Paul uses a prophetic image, the metaphor of the potter and the clay, to illustrate the relationship between the human life and God. In the Old Testament, four messages use the analogy of the potter and the clay: three in Isaiah [Isaiah 29:16; 45:9a; 64:8], and the best-known passage in Jeremiah 18:1-11. Jeremiah at the potter's house had watched the potter at work with a lump of clay. He stood entranced by the spectacle of the workman's subtlety and skill, and heard a Divine voice that said, \"Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel\" [Jeremiah 18:6b]. More than once in his book, Isaiah had called upon God to reveal Himself in His omnipotence. \"We are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.\" [Isaiah 64:8b]. Paul is arguing God's divine prerogative for the admission of Gentiles as well as Jews into the church of Christ. To the person who complains that God is unjust, Paul responds, \"Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay ... \" [v. 20-21a]. The potter claims absolute right in dealing with the lump of clay as he thinks fit, either making it a vessel unto honour, or one unto dishonour. Paul uses the actions of the potter to provide a striking analogy for God's dealing with His people. God formed out of fallen mankind two sorts of vessels - vessels of wrath prepared for destruction [v. 22] and vessels of mercy prepared for glory [v. 23]. Instead of objecting to God's actions, let us heed them and allow our knowledge of judgment and mercy drive us to the repentance we need. O divine Potter, mould me into the image of Jesus my Saviour, Redeemer and Lord. May my life reflect His purity, goodness and grace.",

But God, who is infinite, works both in and outside time. Therefore, it is also accurate to say that one vessel from the same lump will eventually be unto honour, whereas another unto dishonour. Election is the active work of God saving some to eternal life, and reprobation is God allowing others to perish in their sins. From beginning to end, the potter has every right and power over the clay. More importantly, what kind of vessels are we? Made unto honour or made unto dishonour? Saved or perished? Though everything is in God's sovereign hand, we can ask ourselves some questions. Our answers to these questions are not the conditions for our salvation; however, they are signs of our salvation. The first question to ask is, do you love God and the things of God or is your mind all set on pursuing the things of this world? How can you then demand God to love you, if you do not love Him? God has time and again shown to you His existence and goodness, why is it that you refuse to consider your ways and turn your heart to Him? The sad truth is many people love the gift but not the Giver. They are quick to claim eternal life and all the benefits that come with it, both in this life and the next, yet they refuse to surrender themselves to Christ, as both their Saviour and Lord. We should love the Lord Jesus for Who He is and what He has done for us, consecrating our lives and love to Him. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. - 1 John 2:15",

If we put the kingdom and righteousness of God first in our lives, He will add unto us everything that we need [Matthew 6:33]. The second question to ask ourselves is, do we love others? Do we consider the interest of others or only our own? Are we just and merciful in our dealings with others? Are we good testimonies, leading others to Christ through our example or is our behaviour a stumbling block to those who want to know more about the faith? Our deeds and works either lead people to Christ or drive them away from Him. It is apparent that a vessel made unto honour will be one used by God to bless others. One more question we should ask ourselves is, do we love our own souls? Are we careful in keeping our hearts from the ways of the world? Do we seize every opportunity to grow spiritually - reading and hearing God's Word, praying for others and enjoying loving fellowship with one another? Or do we allow our hearts to be enticed by the attractions of this world, leading us away from God? Indeed, the Potter has absolute power over the clay, but that should further motivate us to give diligence in making our calling and election sure [2 Peter 1:10]. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

The full measure of His wrath and power will be displayed at the final judgment. The doctrine of God's wrath has been introduced earlier in the epistle. Romans 1:18 tells us that God revealed His wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness. This wrath is God's just and right response to sin. He cannot be holy and just if He were to condone evil and let sinners go unpunished. His wrath is poured out in proportion to human sinfulness [Romans 2:5]. It is to be feared because all are guilty and condemned sinners apart from Christ [Romans 3:23]. Why does God desire to show His wrath and power? For His glory. Whether sinners receive their just punishment before an all-powerful and holy God, or whether they are objects of His mercy and grace, God is glorified. Indeed, God's wrath makes the Gospel of grace all the more glorious. The severity of His wrath helps us see the seriousness of sin and comprehend the magnitude of His love and mercy in Christ, for the wrath that should have been poured upon us, guilty and condemned sinners, has been transferred upon and satisfied by Christ. Even as we fear and stand in awe of His wrath, let us take refuge in the precious Gospel of Christ, glorifying and praising God both for His wrath and for His mercy. God's wrath in the Bible is never the capricious, self-indulgent, irritable, morally ignoble thing that human anger so often is. It is, instead, a right and necessary reaction to objective moral evil. - J. I. Packer",

In nature, we see His power to preserve and sustain His creation, keeping the entire universe in perfect balance. Through history, God demonstrates His power to fulfil all His purpose. No one and nothing can thwart God's plans. Earlier in verse 17, Paul tells us that God raised Pharaoh up so that His power might be displayed in Pharaoh and God's name proclaimed in all the earth. Ultimately, all opposition and evil only serve to display God's omnipotence. For these, God's power is to be feared because the full measure of God's wrath and power will be poured out on them at the final judgment.

A person who is longsuffering is not quick to retaliate or punish but patiently forebears. We see God's longsuffering in Scripture, in history, and in our lives. When Adam and Eve fell into sin, God did not destroy them straight away. He chose to bear patiently with sinful humanity and initiated the covenant of grace. God patiently tolerated the murmurings and rebellion of Israel in the wilderness, the unfaithfulness of His people in the Promised Land, the rejection of His Son Jesus Christ, the opposition to His church and the persecution of His people. Even when God brought judgment upon the wicked, his judgments were often preceded by much warning and tempered with mercy. Now, God continues to be longsuffering toward us sinners. He patiently forebears for the greater purpose of working out His sovereign plan according to His perfect timing, so that the fullness of His glory and power may be displayed at the consummation of His plan. Just as God is longsuffering with us, He wants us to be longsuffering with others. We cannot be longsuffering toward others by our own strength. Our patience is fleeting compared to God's and we become frustrated easily. Longsuffering is a fruit of the Spirit [Galatians 5:22-23]. It is only when we experience His patience and mercies towards us and submit to Him that we can be vessels of God's patience towards others. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. - Colossians 3:12-13",

That is however not the only reason. Peter gives another reason in 2 Peter 3:9. The context for this verse is that there are scoffers who mock the promise of Christ's return. Peter reminds them that just as God brought judgment by water in the days of Noah, God will bring a greater judgment upon the wicked by fire when Christ returns. God is not slack in fulfilling His promise. Christ's second return has not yet occurred because God \"is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\" God patiently endures our sins and restrains His wrath to allow time for those whom He has elected to repent and come to faith in Christ. Indeed, \"the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation\" [2 Peter 3:15]. God's longsuffering will not continue forever. It will cease. The final judgment will come, and the full measure of God's wrath will be poured forth. The only way to flee this wrath to come is to repent and believe in Jesus. Have you repented? If not, do not delay. Do not presume on God's kindness and longsuffering. Do not harden your heart.

While God justly hands the people who reject Him over to destruction, He has also prepared believers to demonstrate His glory through His mercy to them. God prepared hell and eternal judgment for \"the devil and his angels\" [Matthew 25:41]. Fallen and unrepentant sinners march into hell on account of their sin and rejection of the offer of free grace from God. In His dealing with the elect, God's delay in judging sin and wickedness is because He is longsuffering. Peter says that \"the Lord is not slack concerning His promise (of judgment), as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance\" [2 Peter 3:9]. God's longsuffering is seen in His many pleas to the people. \"I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live\" [Deuteronomy 30:19]. To the house of Israel, God said, \"I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\" [Ezekiel 33:11]. Tragically, the world misreads the longsuffering of God as His unwillingness or His impotence to judge sin thoroughly. Far from it, God's longsuffering is a hallmark of His sovereign mercy so that if a sinner is saved, it is all due to the work of God, and if a sinner is condemned, it is all due to his wilful rebellion, and he cannot blame God for His lack of longsuffering. Sanctification is the preparation of the soul for glory.",

THOUGHT  he glory of God's mercy shines most brilliantly against the dark backdrop of man's sin. Believers are God's chosen vessels of mercy. John Piper writes that the Christian is called out of spiritual deadness and sinful darkness into salvation by mercy, through mercy, and for mercy. He adds, \"By mercy, because in our rebellion we do not deserve to be awakened and opened and subdued to God. Through mercy, because every influence that worked on us to bring us to Christ was a mercy from God. For mercy, because every enjoyment that we will ever have ... will be a merciful enjoyment.\" As vessels of His mercy, we see \"the light of the glorious gospel of Christ\" [2 Corinthians 4:4]. We, Gentiles, are given \"the unsearchable riches of Christ\" [Ephesians 3:8]. And in the ages to come, we will see the \"exceeding riches of (God's) grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus\" [Ephesians 2:7]. When we realise we are vessels of mercy, it means that all the blessings we enjoy are undeserved. This is humbling if you are a believer, and it is unspeakable hope if you are an unbeliever. Perchance you are wondering as you read, \"I am not sure if I am one of God's elect. And how do I know that I am a vessel of God's mercy.\" Paul's answer is: \"There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved\" [Romans 10:12-13]. That is God's abounding in riches for you! If God were to have chosen those who were worthy of His salvation, He would have chosen none.",

THOUGHT  ecause the tribes of Israel were guilty of \"great whoredom, departing from the LORD\" [Hosea 1:2], God told Hosea to marry a woman who was going to be unfaithful to him. So, Hosea married Gomer [Hosea 1:3-9]. Their first child was named \"Jezreel\", referring to \"the motion of scattering to the wind or throwing away\". Their second was named \"Lo-Ruhamah\", meaning \"Not-Loved\" or \"Not-Pitied\". Their third child was named \"Lo-Ammi\", meaning \"Not-MyPeople\". The names of Hosea's children illustrated God's punishment for an unfaithful people. The time came when Gomer left Hosea. She fell into slavery and was auctioned in Samaria. Hosea was instructed to go and buy her back. He bid a high price, and she was his once more. If Hosea had hated Gomer, he could have chosen to kill her or abandon her for the pain she had caused him. Instead, Hosea promised to be a faithful husband to her as he had been, while now demanding faithfulness from her in return. Symbolically, the names of Hosea's children were changed to illustrate God's mercy. Jezreel would now mean \"to be planted\" instead of \"scattered\". The negative prefix in \"Lo-Ruhamah\" would be eliminated to become \"Ruhamah\", or \"Loved\", because God would have love and pity on the people again. \"LoAmmi\" would become \"Ammi\", or \"My People\". When Jesus was crucified, He too responded not with anger towards His punishers. Instead, when they nailed Him to the cross and cast lots for His raiments, Jesus pleaded with God to forgive them, \"for they know not what they do\" [Luke 23:34]. Consider what Christ has done for you in purchasing you from slavery by His own blood. Should we not love Him with all our heart, mind and soul?",

God's rejection meant He would have no special relationship with them and therefore no obligation to them. Once God's people, they had spiralled into an apostate nation living in unbelief. Rightfully did God say, these were \"not My people.\" However, in the same breath, God condescends to these He had called \"Not-My-People\", and said \"Thou art My people\" [Hosea 2:23b]. By these successive declarations, God shows us that salvation is by His grace alone and has nothing to do with a person's worthiness or ancestry. Paul's reference to Hosea also emphasises the divine certainty of God's declarations. While Hosea records that God will simply say they are His people, Paul takes it a step further by stressing that God will call them His people. Paul is emphasising the glorious truth of God's effectual call. This is God's sovereign and irresistible call that will always be answered. It is His call that sinners are summoned to come out of darkness into light. It is His call that sinners come out of the darkness of sin into the new life in Jesus Christ. We once lived in darkness and captivity, in spiritual chains of our own sins. God declares to us that He will call us His people. Regardless of who we are, even the most stubborn of hearts will be overcome by God and found willing in the day when He calls us to Himself.

Indeed, all of us are undeserving of this grand appellation but rather deserving of His wrath and eternal judgment. Yet, we have been chosen, elect from the beginning of time to be His children: sons and daughters of the one true and living God. In this wonderful title, we learn, firstly, that our God is a living God, unlike other gods that are dead idols. And we who belong to Him, are blessed with the protection of the God who is ever with us, ever watchful over us. Our God is the Creator of the universe, and everything that is in it [Colossians 1:16-17]. He is also the Sustainer of this universe, and without His gracious providence, this universe will descend into chaos and anarchy in a second. So, how does a person come to be a child of God? The Scriptures are unequivocal about this: if you believe Christ died for your sins on Calvary's cross, was raised up again on the third day, and has ascended into Heaven, now seated at the right hand of God, and if you have confessed with your mouth that Christ is your Lord, and believe this in your heart, then you are a child of God. Dear reader, have you believed in Jesus Christ and confessed Him to be your Saviour?  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9.",

THOUGHT  ow is it that one comes to believe in this living God? Yesterday we stated that one is called to be a child of God when one truly believes and puts his faith in Jesus Christ and His righteousness, who shed His blood to redeem man from his sins. Yet many of us have attempted and failed to convince our loved ones and friends of this. So, how and why does one come to believe? Firstly, we know from Romans 8:29 that God has chosen those whom He will save. Then verse 30 goes on to say: \"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.\" Apostle Paul, in Romans 8:30, summarizes the process of salvation to eventual glorification of a person. We note that in this process, God is the one who actively calls and enables a person to believe His truth. God is the one who justifies and glorifies him. Therefore, when we share God's truth with anyone, it is not our eloquence, persuasiveness or personality that convinces them to believe in the truth, it is all God's doing. We are just messengers of His message. Therefore, let us humble ourselves before our Lord, and go forth to do His work sharing the Gospel with those around us, knowing that it is God Himself who will work in their hearts to believe and be saved, so that in the end, it is God who is glorified.  For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. - Romans 8:29",

THOUGHT  esterday we saw that the work of salvation is all of God's doing. Let us consider the implications of being called His children. When a newborn baby is given away for adoption, the adoptive family receives the child as their own to love and raise as their own. The child takes on the family name and is expected to love and be devoted to the adoptive parents as his own. In a similar manner, when one is adopted into God's family, he becomes His child and is expected to love and be devoted to his heavenly Father. We are saved for a purpose, to do God's work. Having received forgiveness and escape from eternal condemnation, can we sit around while others are sliding down the slippery slope to hell and eternal judgment? No. We should rather warn them of the folly and danger of their ways. We must equip ourselves with the tools necessary for God's work, namely the Bible, so that we can be effective servants and soldiers for Christ. It is not an easy road but we can trust Him to see us through by His grace. Serving God and doing His work demands total devotion, and we should not be distracted by the world [Matthew 6:24; Luke 9:62]. Fellow labourers in Christ, are you ready to do God's work? Is your heart totally set on serving the true and living God, as His faithful children?  And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. - Luke 9:62",

THOUGHT  n verses 25-26, Paul quoted prophet Hosea in stating how the Gospel would spread to the Gentiles as a result of the Jews' waywardness. Here, he quotes the prophet Isaiah to remind his readers what happened to Israel. \"For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness. For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land\" [Isaiah 10:22-23]. The testimony of Isaiah is firstly a pronouncement of woe. Isaiah prophesied the destruction of Israel. The \"consumption\" (the finished work of destruction) decreed by God would surely come to pass. God's judgment would be a righteous one and declared to every land for even the justice of God shall tell of His glory. Historically, this would point to the destruction of Judah by the Babylonians when many Israelites were deported to foreign lands. Yet the message of Isaiah also carried hope and promise. A remnant of God's chosen race shall be saved - this alluded to the survivors of the invasion and the small number that would return to Israel 70 years after captivity. From God's perspective, Isaiah was prophesying about the Jews who were spiritually lost and whose end was destruction. But he also reminds us that some shall be saved albeit a remnant. The covenantal promise to Abraham is that his descendants would be like the stars in the heaven and the sand of the sea [Genesis 22:17]. Though a great multitude, most would eventually face destruction. Sadly, only a remnant would be saved. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. - Romans 1:16-17",

Yet God is good and gracious - He opened the door of salvation and chose some to be saved through the blood of His only begotten Son. \"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise\" [Galatians 3:2629]. The only way to salvation is Jesus Christ. Those who believe in Him, Jews and Gentiles alike, are called \"Abraham's seed\" in that we are spiritual descendants of Abraham and heirs of God's covenantal promises in the Scriptures. And the whole counsel of God is consistent in saying that those who will be saved are only a remnant, according to God's perfect will. Thank God for salvation rich and free. We who were once lost in our sin and trespasses, are revived by His grace, and enjoy the privilege of calling Him \"Abba, Father\". It pleased God that we would belong to a saved minority. This should not make us self-righteous, but should humble us to live a life of gratitude, praying for God to give us the wisdom and strength to tell this good news to others so that they may also be a part of this remnant. \"Know ye that the LORD He is God: it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.\" [Psalm 100:3] For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. - Deuteronomy 7:6",
