        "part4": "So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to Him that sent me.",
        "part5": "In response to David's confession, the Lord's judgement was pronounced by the prophet Gad. David had three choices: endure seven years of famine in the land, be pursued for three months by his enemies, or suffer three days of pestilence. As Israel's king, all three were detrimental to the kingdom, but David had to choose one.\n\nAt times, we too have difficult decisions to make. It may not be as harmful or deadly as David's choices, but nonetheless, they are difficult ones. One thing we must ask ourselves and search our hearts is whether these choices were the consequence of our sinful actions, as in David's case. Did we obey the Lord fully in our daily lives and life choices? And even if we have not transgressed, realize God may allow difficult situations in our lives without giving us the reason until we meet Him in our heavenly home.\n\nWhat then? Shall we question God and be angry at Him? No, because we know and Scripture affirms that our God is compassionate and He always works things out for the good of those who love Him. We persevere and trust in His goodness and faithfulness to see us through whatever difficult situations we may be put in. Like David, our response to difficult choices should be: \"... let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for His mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man\" [v. 14]. So trust God and not rely on human wisdom, especially our own.",

        "part5": "Although David chose the punishment with the shortest duration of suffering, no King desires to see his people suffer and die. David pleaded with God to lay the punishment upon himself and his family for it was David who originally ordered the numbering of the people [v. 17]. And though David's sin was the immediate cause, the great increase of national offenses at this time had kindled the anger of the Lord [2 Samuel 24:1]. The irony is that David's sinful action of numbering the people was punished by the mass deaths caused by the pestilence. And if it were not for the mercy of God, more would have died [v. 16]. We must remember that sin must be punished. There is no way out; no way for David to escape God's punishment by compensating with good works or past merits. Sin will be punished. Due to man's wickedness God sent a global flood to wipe out all but eight people. Adam and Eve were punished for eating the forbidden fruit. David was punished for committing adultery. Does God punish each and every sin we commit? Yes! Although there may not be an immediate punishment directly following our sins, ultimately they are punishable by our eternal damnation. Yet the God of grace deemed it such that His only begotten Son would take the penalty for us on the cross. God's wrath towards sin was not withdrawn but placed instead upon the Lord Jesus. It was on the cross that His wrath was appeased, and our sins forgiven.",

        "part5": "Imagine that to honour mother on Mother's Day, you decided to treat her to a meal at a fancy restaurant. It would be selfish if the selection of cuisine was according to your preference and not hers. The same principle applies to our worshipping God. Worship is for God, not man. And God has not left us in the dark as to how we should worship Him, but He has showed us His desire.\n\nThe operative phrase in verse 19 is \"as the LORD commanded\", not as David commanded and not as Gad commanded. The incident of the golden calf exemplifies for us that worship cannot be according to our preferences. Worship that deviates from Scripture is termed as \"strange fire\" [Leviticus 10:1]. God's Word should dictate our worship.\n\nThe \"regulative\" principle of worship is worship that is founded upon the instructions of Scripture. We know from Scripture that worship contains the \"reading, (and) exhortation\" of God's Word [1 Timothy 4:13]; and the singing of \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\" [Ephesians 5:19]. Although Scripture is silent on the circumstances of worship (length of time, start time, order of worship etc ...) we should follow the principle given to the church at Corinth that \"all things be done decently and in order\" [1 Corinthians 14:40]. When we worship as God instructed, then our worship will rise as a sweet-smelling savour.",

        "part4": "And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.",
        "part5": "Picture yourself returning home from a restaurant meal with a full belly and leftovers in hand, and you meet a homeless man on the streets. There you sacrifice your leftovers and hand the extra food to him. What did it cost you? Did you suffer hunger because you gave away your leftovers? Did you have to pay extra for the leftovers? No. Your \"sacrifice\" came at no cost. They were mere leftovers.\n\nDavid, however, knew that all genuine sacrifice comes at a price. To offer the Lord burnt offerings that cost him nothing would have been to David a sign of the deepest ingratitude. Although the owner offered them to David for free, he paid for the threshing floor, oxen and wood so that he could build a worthy altar to God. The woman who broke the costly jar of perfume and anointed the Lord Jesus in Mark 14 did so in worshipping Him. The wise men that travelled from afar came bearing valuable gifts of gold, myrrh and frankincense.\n\nIndeed, genuine worship comes at a price. It may require our time and commitment in service. It may require our money for the furtherance of the Gospel work. It may require our gifts and talents in the ministry. Worship is costly and requires our personal sacrifice not because God needs our sacrifice and money but because God is worth it. David worships God because in Him there is forgiveness and mercy in the abatement of the pestilence. Likewise, we worship God because in Him there is eternal life and victory over sin for us at the cross.",
