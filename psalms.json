        "title": "Delight in God's Law",
        "verse": "But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. (Psalm 1:2-3)",
        "text": "The opening psalm contrasts between two men - the godly versus the ungodly. The Bible often presents life's most important choices in the same manner - right or wrong; light or darkness; God or Belial. The way of the godly man is marked by his attitude towards the law of God. Blessed is the man whose \"delight is in the law of the Lord\" [Ps. 1:2].\n\nA \"delight\" is something that brings a great deal of satisfaction, gratification and pleasure. CHS: \"'His delight is in the law of the Lord.' He is not under the law as a curse and condemnation, but he is in it, and he delights to be in it as his rule of life; he delights, moreover, to meditate in it, to read it by day, and think upon it by night. He takes a text and carries it with him all day long; and in the night- watches, when sleep forsakes his eyelids, he museth upon the Word of God. In the day of his prosperity he sings psalms out of the Word of God, and in the night of his affliction he comforts himself with promises out of the same book.\"\n\nBut how could one delight in any law? The law demands absolute obedience. In fact, the letter of the law is described as the \"ministration of death\" [2 Cor. 3:7]. It would be easy to delight in God's mercy and love, but the law? Yes, the godly man's delight is in the law of the Lord.\n\nTo delight in, and to meditate upon the law of the Lord is to think and ponder about the Word of God. To delight in the law is to delight in the Giver of the law. This is the mark of a man's new birth, of a mind held captive by God, of a heart which beats in rhythm to His will; it is the character trait of a child of God.\n\nThe outcome of such a delight is fruitfulness [Ps. 1:3]. The first men to get a flying machine off the ground were the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, in their Wright Flyer in 1903. The plane soared through the skies because the Wright brothers observed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics. Could they have flown the plane if they had ignored these laws? Likewise, the blessedness and fruitfulness of a man's life come from finding delight in his Creator."

        "text": "When God, through Moses, told Pharaoh to free the Israelites, Pharaoh replied, \"Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go\" [Exod. 5:2]. Pharaoh's defiance is an illustration of man's hatred against God, a hatred that is both unreasonable and vain.\n\nCHS: \"Do you dream that you shall snap to pieces and destroy the mandates of God ... and do ye say, 'Let us cast away their cords from us?' ... However mad the resolution to revolt from God, it is one in which man has persevered ever since his creation, and he continues in it to this very day. The glorious reign of Jesus in the latter day will not be consummated, until a terrible struggle has convulsed the nations. His coming will be as a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap, and the day thereof shall burn as an oven. Earth loves not her rightful monarch, but clings to the usurper's sway. The terrible conflicts of the last days will illustrate both the world's love of sin and Jehovah's power to give the kingdom to His only Begotten. To a graceless neck the yoke of Christ is intolerable, but to the saved sinner it is easy and light. We may judge ourselves by this, do we love that yoke, or do we wish to cast it from us?\"\n\nThe Lord laughed in response to man's vain imaginations. This is the only place in the Bible where God is said to have laughed, but it was a laugh of derision; it was a laugh of displeasure and followed by His judgement [Ps. 2:4-5]."

Every Christian is to serve the Lord with fear.\n\nCHS: \"Let reverence and humility be mingled with your service. He is a great God, and ye are but puny creatures; bend ye, therefore, in lowly worship, and let a filial fear mingle with all your obedience to the great Father of the Ages ...  There must ever be a holy fear mixed with the Christian's joy ... Fear, without joy, is torment; and joy, without holy fear, would be presumption.\"\n\nAs a young boy, Harry Ironside, the famous preacher, apprenticed for a godly shoemaker. The man's shop was a real testimony for Christ in the town. Young Harry's job was to prepare the shoe soles. A piece of cowhide would be cut to measure, and then soaked in water. And Harry was to pound the soles until they were hard and dry. It was a tiresome chore.\n\nIn the same town, there was another cobbler, but he never pounded the soles. The man would take the soles, damp as they were and nailed them on. Curious, Harry approached the man, \"I notice you put the soles on while still wet. Are they just as good as if they were pounded?\"\n\nThe man gave a sly snigger and said, \"They come back all the quicker this way, my boy!\"\n\nThinking that this \"trick\" would help his boss, Harry suggested that he should do the same thing. The old man turned to Harry and said, \"I do not cobble shoes just for a living. I am doing this for the glory of God. When I meet my Saviour, I do not want Him to say to me, 'You did not do your best with this pair.' I want Him to be able to say, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.'\""

David was able to sleep when surrounded by his enemies because God was with him.\n\nCHS: \"David's faith enabled him to lie down; anxiety would certainly have kept him on tiptoe, watching for an enemy ... but he, though exposed to many enemies, reclined his head on the bosom of his God, slept happily beneath the wing of Providence in sweet security, and then awoke in safety.\"\n\nDavid's deliverance came from no other but God. Salvation belongeth to the Lord. CHS: \"Salvation from first to last, in every iota of it, belongs to the Most High God. It is God that chooses His people. He calls them by His grace; He quickens them by His Spirit, and keeps them by His power.\"\n\nIt is not who you are that saves you - it is Christ.\nIt is not what you can do that saves you - it is Christ.\nIt is not even what you can do for Christ that saves you - it is Christ.\nIt is not your hold on Christ that saves you - it is Christ.\nIt is not even your faith that saves you.\nThough faith is the instrument, it is in Christ's blood and merit that\nsalvation is proffered."

But David called out to the Lord, knowing God would protect those whom He had chosen.\n\nCHS: \"Election is a ... glorious and well-attested truth, and one which should comfort the tempted believer. Election is the guarantee of complete salvation, and an argument for success at the throne of grace. He who chose us for Himself will surely hear our prayer. The Lord's elect shall not be condemned, nor shall their cry be unheard ... when you are on your knees, the fact of your being set apart as God's own peculiar treasure, should give you courage and inspire you with fervency and faith ... Since He chose to love us He cannot but chose to hear us.\"\n\nJohn G. Paton was a missionary to the New Hebrides in the South Pacific. One day, he found himself surrounded by armed natives. Listen to the story in Paton's own words: \"I then lifted my hands and eyes to the heavens, and prayed aloud for Jesus to bless all my dear Tannese [the natives], and either to protect me or to take me home to glory, as He saw to be for the best. One after another they slipped away from me, and Jesus restrained them once again.

        "text": "This is the first of the penitential psalms which expresses the sinner's sorrow for his sins. In this psalm, David was overwhelmed by his sense of guilt before God [vv. 1-3], and he was overcome by the loss of God's presence [v. 4]. Because of his sins, the Lord had departed from David. A separation no doubt made more intense because David was a man after God's own heart, so he cried, \"O Lord, how long?\"\n\nAlthough David was intensely aware of God's displeasure, he was also conscious of God's loving-kindness - \"Oh save me for Thy mercy's sake.\" That is the sinner's only recourse. Note the number of times the name of Jehovah was invoked in the first five verses. God is ever ready to forgive. He delights in mercy. Upon this blessed truth, David pleaded for the Lord to return.\n\nCHS: \"The coming of Christ into the soul in His priestly robes of grace is the grand hope of the penitent soul ... Christ's appearance is, and ever has been, the hope of the saints ... As God's absence was the main cause of his misery, so His return would be enough to deliver him from his trouble ... He knows where to look, and what arm to lay hold upon. He does not lay hold on God's left hand of justice, but on His right hand of mercy. He knew his iniquity too well to think of merit, or appeal to anything but the grace of God ... What a plea that is! How prevalent it is with God! If we turn to justice, what plea can we urge? But if we turn to mercy we may still cry, notwithstanding the greatness of our guilt, 'Save me for Thy mercies' sake.'\""

        "text": "David was in great sorrow. \"I water my couch with my tears. Mine eye is consumed because of grief ... \" [vv. 6-7]. But his cries became his prayers. Every tear he shed became a river of grace. Every groan he made ascended to the Lord as prayers.\n\nDavid was sure of one thing - God would not leave him or forsake him. David expressed that confidence three times within two verses - \"The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer\" [vv. 8-9].\n\nCHS: \"Is there a voice in weeping? Does weeping speak? In what language doth it utter its meaning? Why, in that universal tongue which is known and understood in all the earth, and even in heaven above ... Weeping is the eloquence of sorrow. It is an unstammering orator, needing no interpreter, but understood of all. Is it not sweet to believe that our tears are understood even when words fail! Let us learn to think of tears as liquid prayers, and of weeping as a constant dropping of importunate intercession which will wear its way right surely into the very heart of mercy, despite the stony difficulties which obstruct the way. My God, I will 'weep' when I cannot plead, for Thou hearest the voice of my weeping.\"\n\nDavid prayed and he was content to leave the matter in the hands of God. As is often the case, our prayers are accompanied by our ideas about how God should answer them. We expect God to work all things according to our plans. We expect our problems to fade away. However, we must recognize that it is for God's perfect plan and our own good that things do not turn out the way we think they should.\n\nWe have to learn to trust that it is good enough that the Lord has heard and will receive our prayers. What is required of us is the faith to commit our ways to Him, and trust that He who hears our cries knows our circumstances, and that He will give grace according to our needs."

Common fame, although notoriously a common liar, has very many believers. Once let an ill word get into men's mouths, and it is not easy to get it fully out again ...  Good repute is like the cypress, once cut, it never puts forth leaf again ... it is a meanness most detestable to stab a good man in his reputation, but diabolical hatred observes no nobility in its mode of warfare.\"\n\nWas David perfect? By no means; but in this instance, he was innocent of the crime of which he was charged. Knowing that God is omniscient, David pleaded his case before the heavenly tribunal. Only a man who is sure of his innocence would make such a petition - \"Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.\"\n\nHow deep must be the divine knowledge of the Lord Who tries the hearts of man. How intimate must be the search of the Lord Who sees our secret thoughts and inward affections. How transparent are we before the Lord with Whom \"all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with Whom we have to do\"? Keep your life straight so that you would not have to bend your words to defend yourself. With an upright heart, there is no need for superfluous words when a simple prayer to God would suffice."

When God shall try our cause, our sun has risen, and the sun of the wicked is set for ever. Truth, like oil, is ever above, no power of our enemies can drown it; we shall refute their slanders in the day when the trumpet wakes the dead, and we shall shine in honour when lying lips are put to silence. O believer, fear not all that thy foes can do or say against thee, for the tree which God plants no winds can hurt.\"\n\nWe do not know if David received the justice that he was seeking. From the context of the psalm, it seems likely that at the time of its writing, David's grievances had not been addressed. Nevertheless, David ended the psalm on a high note of exultation: \"I will praise the Lord according to His righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high\" [v. 17]. Cry for justice? Surely we must; but we must continue to live righteously no matter what. It is better for Christians to suffer injustice and maintain our testimony than to join the ranks of the unrighteous and commit the very acts from which we had asked God for deliverance."

Daily rejoicing is an ornament to the Christian character, and a suitable robe for God's choristers to wear.

Smilingly, the man replied, \"I thank Jesus that He has given me my life and being, a heart to love Him, and above all a constant desire to serve Him!\" Wesley saw in this man the meaning of true thankfulness and whole-hearted praise.\n\nMany years later, as John Wesley lay on his deathbed, he began to sing a hymn written by Isaac Watts:\n\nI'll praise my Maker while I've breath,\nAnd when my voice is lost in death,\nPraise shall employ my nobler power;\nMy days of praise shall ne'er be past,\nWhile life, and thought, and being last,\nOr immortality endures."

Our feeble faith prompts us to ask, \"What if God is not here to help?\" After a time of training to hunt, scout and fish, an American native boy was given a final test to prove his adulthood. In the middle of the night, the boy was blindfolded and taken several miles deep into the forest - he was to spend the night there alone. This was the first time he was away from the safety of his loved ones. Every sound in the woods terrified him. The night seemed to stretch into eternity. But as the first rays of light peeked through the trees, he knew that he was not too far from home. Better than that, he saw the figure of a man standing just a few feet away, armed with a bow and arrow. It was his father. He had been there all night long.

Persecutors and oppressors are often ruined by their own malicious projects ... Thus, men may reap their sin in their punishment. They sowed the seed of sin, and the ripe fruit of damnation is the natural result.\"\n\nDavid's prayer ends with the confidence in God's victory. He prays that the Lord would prevail; not man - not even David himself.

When the days are weary, the long nights dreary, I know my Savior cares.\"\n\nCHS: \"The presence of God is the joy of His people, but any suspicion of His absence is distracting beyond measure. Let us, then, ever remember that the Lord is nigh us. The refiner is never far from the mouth of the furnace when his gold is in the fire, and the Son of God is always walking in the midst of the flames when his holy children are cast into them ... If we need an answer to the question, 'Why hidest Thou Thyself?' it is to be found in the fact that there is a 'needs be' not only for trial, but for heaviness of heart under trial ... God bares the back that the blow may be felt; for it is only felt affliction which can become blest affliction. If we are carried in the arms of God over every stream, where would be the trial, and where the experience, which trouble is meant to teach us?\"\n\nOn the day before Joseph Scriven's wedding, his fiancee drowned. Heart- broken, Scriven could find no solace anywhere except in his dearest friend, the Lord Jesus Christ. The tragedy also changed his life. Scriven devoted his life to the mission work in Port Hope, Ontario. Because of his selfless sacrifice, Scriven became known as \"Good Samaritan of Port Hope\". When Scriven heard that his mother was seriously ill, he wrote to encourage her, and in his letter, he enclosed his newly-composed poem:\n\nWhat a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!\nWhat a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!\nO what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear,\nAll because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.\n\nWhat a Friend we have in Jesus indeed."

This verse [v. 12] is the incessant cry of the Church, and she will never refrain therefrom until her Lord shall come in His glory to avenge her of all her adversaries ... God is all eye to see, and all hand to punish his enemies ... Wanton mischief shall meet with woeful misery, and those who harbour spite shall inherit sorrow ... God is the parent of all orphans.

Our Lord Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for shrouding their false pretences with long prayer [Matt. 23:14]. Prayers need not be eloquent. We do not need to \"talk better\" to be heard by God. But prayers need to be offered up in faith. \"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive\" [Matt. 21:22].\n\nCHS: \"A short but sweet, suggestive, seasonable, and serviceable prayer; a kind of angel's sword, to be turned every way, and to be used on all occasions ...  'Help, Lord,' is a very useful ejaculation which we may dart up to heaven on occasions of emergency, whether in labour, learning, suffering, fighting, living, or dying. As small ships can sail into harbours which larger vessels, drawing more water, cannot enter, so our brief cries and short petitions may trade with heaven when our soul is wind-bound, and business-bound, as to longer exercises of devotion, and when the stream of grace seems at too low an ebb to float a more laborious supplication.\"\n\nWe can ask God for any need.

Its authority is the power behind our preaching.\n\nCHS: \"To fall into the hands of an evil generation, so as to be baited by their cruelty, or polluted by their influence, is an evil to be dreaded beyond measure; but it is an evil foreseen and provided for in the text. In life many a saint has lived a hundred years before his age, as though he had darted his soul into the brighter future, and escaped the mists of the beclouded present: he has gone to his grave unreverenced and misunderstood, and lo! as generations come and go, upon a sudden the hero is unearthed, and lives in the admiration and love of the excellent of the earth; preserved for ever from the generation which stigmatised him as a sower of sedition, or burned him as a heretic. It should be our daily prayer that we may rise above our age as the mountain-tops above the clouds, and may stand out as heaven-pointing pinnacle high above the mists of ignorance and sin which roll around us.\"\n\nDavid began with this prayer: \"Help, Lord!\" He asked for deliverance and God's answer to him was: \"Thou shalt keep them, O Lord!\" Why did God answer David's prayer?

He is sure of his faith, and his faith makes him sure; had he doubted the reality of his trust in God, he would have blocked up one of the windows through which the sun of heaven delights to shine.

While men's hearts remain what they are, we must not be surprised at the prevalence of skepticism; a corrupt tree will bring forth corrupt fruit ... The spread of mere intellectual enlightenment will not diminish their number, for since it is an affair of the heart ...

Without the wedding-dress of righteousness in Christ Jesus, we have no right to sit at the banquet of communion.\"\n\nA man is saved by grace. But a saved man must also be seen by his graces. The Psalmist is merely describing the fruits of the man made righteous by Christ Jesus. Such a man is like a superstructure of truth and faith built upon the hidden foundation of our Lord Jesus.

This might be the reason why it was quoted by the apostles Peter and Paul [Acts 2:25-31; 13:35-37].\n\nThe Psalmist uses three names of God: Firstly, \"God\" [El], which means the Mighty One; and He Who is our Refuge; secondly, \"Lord\" [Jehovah] which means \"I AM THAT I AM\". This is God's covenant name for His chosen people; and lastly, \"Lord\" [Adonai], and by this name, the Psalmist confesses that God is his Master. By these names, the Psalmist expresses his complete submission to, and security in, God.\n\nCHS: \"Content beyond measure with his portion in the Lord his God, he had not a single desire with which to hunt after other gods; his cup was full, and his heart was full too; even in his sorest sorrows he still laid hold with both his hands upon his Father, crying, 'My God, my God;' ... We, too, can make our boast in the Lord; He is the meat and the drink of our souls.

As children of the Father Who is in heaven, we inherit, by virtue of our joint heirship with Jesus, all the riches of the covenant of grace; and the portion which falls to us sets upon our table the bread of heaven and the new wine of the kingdom.

Father, Son and Spirit have each a claim upon our love. The solemn purpose never to cease loving naturally springs from present fervour of affection, it is wrong to make rash resolutions, but this when made in the strength of God is most wise and fitting.\"\n\nThe feeble strength that David could muster to love God was more than reciprocated by the Lord. From his one expression of love for the Lord, David poured forth a gush of praise; God was not just David's Lord, He was also David's immovable Rock, his Fortress impregnable, his faithful Deliverer, his all-sufficient Strength, his unyielding Buckler, his certain Horn of Salvation [defense], and his ever-standing High Tower."

Would the Lord prove Himself true?\n\nThe Lord not only responded, but He did so in unmistakable ways - He descended in a mighty display of earthquakes, storms and lightnings. These are poetic terms depicting the wrath of God. The language here resembles closely, God's descent upon Mount Sinai at the giving of the Ten Commandments [Exod. 20:18].\n\nCHS: \"The storm thickened, and the clouds pouring forth torrents of rain combined to form the secret chamber of the invisible but wonder-working God. 'Pavilioned in impervious shade', faith saw Him, but no other eye could gaze through the 'thick clouds of the skies'. Blessed is the darkness which encurtains my God; if I may not see Him, it is sweet to know that He is working in secret for my eternal good. Even fools can believe that God is abroad in the sunshine and the calm, but faith is wise, and discerns Him in the terrible darkness and threatening storm.\"\n\nGod moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform;\nHe plants His footsteps in the sea, And rides upon the storm.\nYe fearful saints, fresh courage take ... \nJudge not the Lord by feeble sense, But trust Him for His grace\nBehind a frowning providence, He hides a smiling face.\n[William Cowper]"

Large indeed is the possession and place of the believer in Jesus, there need be no limit to his peace, for there is no bound to his privilege.\"\n\nThe Lord is not a miser of mercy; in Him, you will find a multitude of His tender mercies. He is not a grudging giver of His grace; where sin abound, His grace did much more abound. He is a not penny-pincher of His peace; His peace passes all understanding. The Lord has given us His only Son, \"shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\" [Rom. 8:32].

Could David honestly say that his hands were cleaned, that he was upright?\n\nThere was no pride in David's words if we understand that his righteousness was given to him. Before the holy God, even the best of man is a filthy sinner. However, with his heart purified by the Lord, David could say without any hypocrisy that he was upright. While the redeemed man would humbly acknowledge that he is a sinner, it would be false modesty to deny the work of grace in his heart.\n\nDavid further asserted his righteousness in two ways; CHS: \"There is 'I have' and 'I have not,' both of which must be blended in a truly sanctified life; constraining and restraining grace must each take its share. The words of this verse refer to the saint as a traveller carefully keeping to 'the ways of the Lord', and 'not wickedly,' that is, designedly, wilfully, persistently, defiantly forsaking the ordained pathway in which God favours the pilgrim with His presence. Observe how it is implied in the expression 'and have not wickedly departed from my God,' that David lived habitually in communion with God, and knew Him to be his own God, Whom he might speak of as 'my God'. God never departs from His people, let them take heed of departing from Him.\"\n\nThe best defence for your righteousness is to acknowledge the Lord as your God. Echo David's confident claim  -  I am righteous because I am saved by grace Eph. 2:8-9]. I am upright because I stand by grace [Rom. 5:2].

In the darkest hour light will arise; a candle shall be lit ... it will be our own candle; yet God Himself will find the holy fire with which the candle shall burn ... truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun; and even so the presence of the Lord removes all the gloom of sorrow, and enables the believer to rejoice with exceeding great joy. The lighting of the lamp is a cheerful moment in the winter's evening, but the lifting up of the light of God's countenance is happier far. It is said that the poor in Egypt will stint themselves of bread to buy oil for the lamp, so that they may not sit in darkness; we could well afford to part with all earthly comforts if the light of God's love could but constantly gladden our souls.\"\n\nThe Old Testament Tabernacle comprised of four layers of covering -  embroidered curtains and three separate coverings made from goats' hair, rams' skins, and badgers' skins.

There was no cause in Him, why then was He deserted? 'Hast': it is done, and the Saviour is feeling its dread effect as He asks the question; it is surely true, but how mysterious! It was no threatening of forsaking which made the great Surety cry aloud, He endured that forsaking in very deed. 'Thou': I can understand why traitorous Judas and timid Peter should be gone, but Thou, my God, my faithful Friend, how canst Thou leave me? This is worst of all, yea, worse than all put together. Hell itself has for its fiercest flame the separation of the soul from God. 'Forsaken': if Thou hadst chastened I might bear it, for Thy face would shine; but to forsake me utterly, ah! why is this?

Man by nature is but a worm; but our Lord puts Himself even beneath man, on account of the scorn which was heaped upon Him and the weakness which He felt, and therefore He adds, 'and no man.'\"\n\nThe kenosis of Christ refers to His humiliation.

A literal translation would read this way, \"No, I will not leave thee; no, neither will I not utterly forsake thee.\"\n\nThis promise is made to those who are patiently bearing affliction or persecution for Christ's sake. It may be applied to the righteous who may be going through suffering or adversity of any kind. When crises set in, when human help is in vain, look to the Lord, trust in Him, and call out to Him for He is always near."

        "text": "Crucifixion is a cruel penalty. It brings death deliberately, second by second. The crucified man is nailed to the cross, with his hands outstretched. His only support was perhaps a little platform for his nail-pierced feet. To breathe, he would have to heave himself, working against the pain, and twisting his joints out of place [v. 14]. With such excruciating pain, it would not be strange if his heart failed [v. 14]. Exposed to the elements, the man suffers thirst [v. 15]. To add insult to pain, this punishment was carried out in the open - \"they look and stare upon me.\" The Psalmist also described the enemies of God as animals - bulls of Bashan [v. 12], lions [vv. 13, 21], dogs [vv. 16, 20], unicorns [v. 21]. There seemed to be a circus atmosphere surrounding the death of our Saviour.\n\nCHS: \"Here he marks the more ignoble crowd, who, while less strong than their brutal leaders, were not less ferocious, for there they were howling and barking like unclean and hungry dogs. Hunters frequently surround their game with a circle, and gradually encompass them with an ever narrowing- ring of dogs and men. Such a picture is before us. In the centre stands, not a panting stag, but a bleeding, fainting man, and around him are the enraged and unpitying wretches who have hounded him to his doom. Here we have the 'hind of the morning' of whom the psalm so plaintively sings, hunted by bloodhounds, all thirsting to devour him. The assembly of the wicked have inclosed me ... this is not the only occasion when professed churches of God have become synagogues of Satan, and have persecuted the Holy One and the Just.\"\n\nThe story of our Lord Jesus did not end at the cross. The people saw crucifixion as an instrument of punishment; Jesus saw it as one of reconciliation. They wanted Him to die; He did and brought life. God took the worst thing that man could do to His Son, and changed it into the best thing He could do for man."

The turning point comes in verse 22, with a call to praise God and to glorify Him.\n\nAlthough David writes in the first person, he is but the shadow of this glorious psalm. The light that casts the shadow is our Lord Jesus Christ. Our Lord did not cry out in vain, nor was God the Father indifferent to His cries. \"For He [God the Father] hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the Afflicted [God the Son]; neither hath He [the Father] hid His face from Him [the Son]; but when He [the Son] cried unto Him [the Father], He heard\" [v. 24].\n\nThe Son cried; the Father heard; and sinners are redeemed. The righteous should neither be afraid nor ashamed of praising God. Note the public nature of David's praise [v. 22]. \"My praise shall be of Thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear Him\" [v. 25].\n\nWhat was David's praise? The spiritual banquet prepared for souls. CHS: \"Mark how the dying Lover of our souls solaces Himself with the result of His death. The spiritually poor find a feast in Jesus, they feed upon Him to the satisfaction of their hearts; they were famished until He gave Himself for them, but now they are filled with royal dainties. The thought of the joy of His people gave comfort to our expiring Lord ... Your spirits shall not fail through trial, you shall not die of grief, immortal joys shall be your portion. Thus Jesus speaks even from the cross to the troubled seeker. If His dying words are so assuring, what consolation may we not find in the truth that He ever liveth to make intercession for us! They who eat at Jesus' table receive the fulfilment of the promise, 'Whosoever eateth of this bread shall live for ever.'\"\n\nWho shall qualify to sit at this heavenly table?

Thousands of pages have been written about this psalm, with thousands more written just on the first line alone - Jehovah is my Shepherd.\n\nThe contrast in the first verse cannot be greater. One end is the eternal God, Jehovah - the great I AM THAT I AM; and on the other end is man, whose life is as brief and frail as the grass in the field. Yet He is our shepherd.\n\nCHS: \"David had himself been a keeper of sheep, and understood both the needs of the sheep and the many cares of a shepherd. He compares himself to a creature weak, defenceless, and foolish, and he takes God to be his Provider, Preserver, Director, and, indeed, his everything. No man has a right to consider himself the Lord's sheep unless his nature has been renewed, for the scriptural description of unconverted men does not picture them as sheep, but as wolves or goats. A sheep is an object of property, not a wild animal; its owner sets great store by it, and frequently it is bought with a great price. It is well to know, as certainly David did, that we belong to the Lord ... 'The Lord is my shepherd;' if he be a Shepherd to no one else, he is a Shepherd to me; he cares for me, watches over me, and preserves me. The words are in the present tense. Whatever be the believer's position, he is even now under the pastoral care of Jehovah.\"\n\nSometimes we worry about our future - our needs, our children, and a whole host of other things. But there should neither be room for doubt nor cause for fear when we have the Lord as our shepherd. We may not know what lies in the future, but it is enough to know that the Lord is our Good Shepherd. \"The Lord is my shepherd\" - in Him, we have perfect salvation; \"I shall not want\" - in Him, we have perfect satisfaction."

It is important that a man's external conduct be right, but it is even more important that his motives and thoughts are pure.\n\nCHS: \"Outward, practical holiness is a very precious mark of grace. To wash in water with Pilate is nothing, but to wash in innocency is all-important. It is to be feared that many professors have perverted the doctrine of justification by faith in such a way as to treat good works with contempt; if so, they will receive everlasting contempt at the last great day. It is vain to prate of inward experience unless the daily life is free from impurity, dishonesty, violence, and oppression. Those who draw near to God must have 'clean hands' ... But 'clean hands' would not suffice, unless they were connected with 'a pure heart.' True religion is heart-work ...  the very life of our being lies in the inner nature, and hence the imperative need of purity within. There must be a work of grace in the core of the heart as well as in the palm of the hand, or our religion is a delusion.\"\n\nRobert Murray McCheyne, the Scottish preacher, when writing to his good friend on the occasion of his ordination as a missionary, noted, \"In great measure, according to the purity and perfections of the instrument, will be the success.

This psalm does not have one particular theme; rather, it comprises a series of random thoughts about God. An aged and perhaps more contemplative David, it seemed, was recalling the blessedness of being a child of God. One such train of thought was the Lord's tender mercies and loving-kindnesses throughout his days. What a blessed assurance to know that our Lord knows exactly what to remember, and what to forget.\n\nCHS: \"We are usually tempted in seasons of affliction to fear that our God has forgotten us, or forgotten His usual kindness towards us; hence the soul doth as it were put the Lord in remembrance, and beseech Him to recollect those deeds of love which once He wrought towards it ... Those offences which we remember with repentance God forgets, but if we forget them, justice will bring them forth to punishment. The world winks at the sins of young men, and yet they are not so little after all; the bones of our youthful feastings at Satan's table will stick painfully in our throats when we are old men. He who presumes upon his youth is poisoning his old age. How large a tear may wet this page as some of us reflect upon the past!\"\n\nDavid asked God to remember him, not according to his sins, but according to God's mercy. In Hebrew, the same word is translated as \"loving-kindnesses\" [v. 6]. God's mercy is also His love.\n\nNote that the sins of David's youth were more than covered by God's tender mercies and loving-kindnesses, for they had been ever of old, meaning to say that they are from eternity to eternity.\n\nThere is never a time when God's grace and mercy is not available to the redeemed. God's love is constant, unchanging and unceasing. That is why no one who waits on Him shall be ashamed."

He is interested in himself - self-indulgence [preoccupation with one's desires], self-absorption [preoccupation with one's ego], self-pity [preoccupation with one's disappointments], and self- esteem [preoccupation with one's ability]. There are some people who are so preoccupied with themselves that they do not even look at the needs of others. Do you know that the difference between a clear glass [that allows a man to look into the world] and a mirror [that places the focus of a man on himself ] is just a thin layer of silver?\n\nTruly it is only by the converting power of the Holy Spirit that a man's gaze turns from himself to our Lord Jesus Christ; and to his neighbours.\n\nCHS: \"The writer claims to be fixed in his trust, and constant in his expectation; he looks in confidence, and waits in hope. We may add to this look of faith and hope the obedient look of service, the humble look of reverence, the admiring look of wonder, the studious look of meditation, and the tender look of affection. Happy are those whose eyes are never removed from their God. 'The eye,' says Solomon, 'is never satisfied with seeing,' but this sight is the most satisfying in the world.\"\n\n\"My eyes are ever toward the Lord\" refers to more than just visual images. Where a man beholds and looks forward to represent his love, longings, and loyalties, the Psalmist's only hope is the Lord - \"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith\" [Heb. 12:2a].\n\nNote where the Psalmist looks; and where his feet land. When we look to our Lord Jesus, it matters not where our feet land. As we look to our Lord, He is also looking at us, and when our feet are caught in the net, He will be there to pick us up.

This exhortation to look to our Lord is for our own good. It is only when we have our eyes fixed on Him that we have the assurance that He is looking at us.\n\nOur Lord Jesus had sent His disciples ahead to Bethsaida on the other side of Galilee while he retreated for prayer. When the disciples were sailing across the sea, they were caught in a storm. Without the Master with them, they feared for their lives. But while they were battling to save their lives, our Lord Jesus \"saw them toiling in rowing ... [and] He cometh unto them\" [Mark 6:47- 48]. Our Lord looked upon their afflictions.\n\nCHS: \" ... note yet more the submissive and believing spirit of a true saint; all he asks for is, 'Lord, look upon my evil plight;' he does not dictate, or even express a complaint; a look from God will content him, and that being granted he asks no more. Even more noteworthy is the way in which the believer under affliction discovers the true source of all the mischief, and lays the axe at the root of it.\"\n\nNo affliction of the body can be worse than the affliction of sin upon the soul. CHS: \"'Forgive all my sins,' is the cry of a soul that is more sick of sin than of pain, and would sooner be forgiven than healed. Blessed is the man to whom sin is more unbearable than disease ... [it] shall not be long before the Lord shall both forgive his iniquity and heal his diseases.\"\n\nDavid asked the Lord to look kindly upon his afflictions, but he did not dictate what God should do. It is up to God's sovereign will to deliver. However, in the matter of sin, David knew what the Lord will do - forgive all his sins. If we carry our sorrows to our Lord, even more so, we must carry our sins to Him because every one of them must be forgiven."

He willingly placed himself under God's light. \"Judge me ... examine me ... prove me ... try my reins and my heart.\" David was asking the Lord to determine whether the evidences of his faith were genuine, whether his testimony was authentic. David had nothing to hide.\n\nDavid was not concerned with his reputation among men. Reality has shown that no matter how good we are, our foes will always have something bad to say about us. David's concern was God's thoughts about him. Reputation is what men think you are. Integrity and character is what God knows you to be. CHS: \"[David] held integrity as his principle, and walked in it as his practice. David had not used any traitorous or unrighteous means to gain the crown, or to keep it; he was conscious of having been guided by the noblest principles of honour in all his actions with regard to Saul and his family. What a comfort it is to have the approbation of one's own conscience! If there be peace within the soul, the blustering storms of slander which howl around us are of little consideration.\"\n\nIntegrity means wholeness. It means that your heart is not at odds; your allegiance is not divided. The opposite of integrity is duplicity  -  to be divided in one's mind and heart. Such a man is \"unstable in all his ways\" [James 1:8]. Our Lord demands us to make a choice. \"Choose you this day whom ye will serve\" [Josh. 24:15a]; \"How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then follow him\" [1 Kings 18:21]; \"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other ... Ye cannot serve God and mammon\" [Matt. 6:24]. You cannot love God and the world at the same time [1 John 2:15]. God made man with one heart for a reason - to love Him and Him alone."

To the Reformers, such an aversion to a Bible-preaching church is unbiblical.\n\nJohn Calvin wrote that if a Church preached the gospel reverently, \"no man may with impunity spurn her authority, or reject her admonitions, or resist her counsels ... revolt from her, and violate her unity\" [Institutes, Book VI.1.10]. He added that all who alienate themselves from the church would be regarded as \"traitors and apostates\".\n\nWhen the Eiffel tower was built for the World Expo, the majority of the Parisians considered it an eyesore.

While the external circumstances in David's life might not have been rosy, the internal condition of his spirit was hopeful. David reveals the secret of sustaining faith in troubling times - a faith that is expressed in the most personal terms.\n\nThe LORD is certainly not one of many lights. The LORD might have been someone else's light. The LORD was also not the light. None of these statements was good enough for David until he states emphatically - \"the Lord is my light ... my salvation ... the strength of my life.\"\n\nCHS: \"Salvation finds us in the dark, but it does not leave us there; it gives light to those who sit in the valley of the shadow of death. After conversion our God is our joy, comfort, guide, teacher, and in every sense our light; He is light within, light around, light reflected from us, and light to be revealed to us. Note, it is not said merely that the LORD gives light, but that He 'is' light; nor that He gives salvation, but that He is salvation; He, then, who by faith has laid hold upon God has all covenant blessings in his possession. Every light is not the sun, but the sun is the father of all lights.\"\n\nHere we see that David's personal faith is also his preserving faith. When God saves us, He will also keep us. If God has done the most difficult thing, which is salvation, He will also do the lesser ones. God who \"spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\" (Rom. 8:32).\n\nAnd it is David's preserving faith that helped in his persevering in the faith. David's enemies were powerful and numerous. One puritan preacher says that \"experience breeds hope and confidence\", but it must be qualified that it is not. But David's confidence was neither in his own ability, nor did his hope rest upon his own strength. His hope and confidence were founded upon God's faithfulness. David had a record of God's faithfulness, and so must we."

David praises God for His strength, and that is his basis for fearlessness.\n\nDavid's confidence in the Lord was the reason for his one desire - to dwell in the house of the Lord. The place of God's abode meant many things to David, and he used several names to describe it: house, temple, pavilion and tabernacle. The last description was the most accurate because the temple then had not been built; God's house was just a tent. But the physical building was of little consequence - David's real desire was to be in the presence of the Almighty. David was like the son with one singular desire - longing for home and the presence of his father.\n\nCHS: \"Divided aims tend to distraction, weakness, disappointment. The man of one book is eminent, the man of one pursuit is successful. Let all our affection[s] be bound up in one affection, and that affection set upon heavenly things.\"\n\nOur desires are only as good as our deeds. Desires are but dreams if they are not accompanied by a holy determination to make them come true. A man wishes he could pray more fervently; he wishes that he could serve more faithfully; he hopes to read the Bible more frequently; yet these wishes remain empty and unfulfilled unless he works them out in his life.\n\nDavid's desire was to behold the beauty of God, to inquire and to be protected. Likewise, in our worship, we must focus entirely on God's greatness, grace and glory [for He is our Salvation]; to be enlightened in the Truth [for He is our Light]; and to be comforted in afflictions [for He is our Strength]."

David cried as if his closest kin had deserted him, but not God. Jehovah would not abandon His own.\n\nThe abandonment of David by his friends and families was not all bad because the experience drew him near to God. When your friends would neither lend a sympathetic ear or a helping hand, there is God Who would answer. When you are let down, there is God to take you up.\n\nBut like David, we must learn to trust the goodness of God. CHS: \"Faintness of heart is a common infirmity ... Faith ...

We must believe to see, not see to believe; we must wait the appointed time, and stay our soul's hunger with foretastes of the Lord's eternal goodness which shall soon be our feast and our song.\"\n\nWe must also learn to wait. In Hebrew, it literally means \"to bind together\". To wait on the Lord means to bind yourself together with Him. Picture yourself as a weak and frail strand, but you are being weaved into the strong cord of the Almighty. Like David, we would have fainted, but we must learn to wait on the Lord, and He will strengthen your heart.

God's silence, then, is not a sign to stop praying, but a signal to pray on!\n\nPray on, when rough and dark your pathway,\nAnd you cannot see the light;\nWhen every spark of hope has vanished,\nAnd bright day has turned to night.\nPray on, for God doth surely hear you,\nNoting well each sad request;\nPray then in faith, truly believing\nThat He always gives what's best.\n[Adam Baum]"

He was persistent in his praying, and he was also profuse in his praise and thanksgiving - \"therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise Him\" (v. 7). Are you a thankful person?\n\nPsalm 28 is written in the first person account with the exception of the eighth verse, where David includes the righteous into the picture. God who was David's strength and shield is also ours. The Lord Who was David's deliverer is also our saving strength. Praise the Lord that He treats us no less than He had treated David because we are also His anointed.\n\nCHS: The Lord \"infuses strength into us in our hour of weakness ... Dependence upon the invisible God gives great independence of spirit, inspiring us with confidence more than human ... David found both sword and shield in his God. The Lord preserves His people from unnumbered ills; and the Christian warrior, sheltered behind his God, is far more safe than the hero when covered with his shield of brass or triple steel.\"\n\nThe Lord works in our lives in numerous ways. Sometimes, He is our shield. As a shield, the Lord stands in front of us and stops the fiery darts of afflictions and temptations so that we never feel their pernicious blows. As our shield, our Lord delivers us from the dangers so that we never have to go through them.\n\nAt other times, the Lord is our strength. In those times, the Lord allows us to go through the trials. However, He stands beside us to bear us up in our weakness so that we would never fall. In either case, we would emerge as better people with our faith strengthened, and our hope assured."

        "text": "This is a psalm of pure praise unto the Lord. David paints a portrait of Jehovah. This revered name of God is used in every verse of this psalm. Jehovah refers to God as the self-existent One, Who in Himself possesses essential life and eternal existence. Jehovah also distinguishes God as the One Who made the covenant with Israel (Exod. 3:15). What can the mighty do in the presence of Jehovah? The only appropriate thing to do is to worship but not by our own imagination but in the beauty of holiness.\n\nCHS: \"'Worship the Lord,' bow before Him with devout homage and sacred awe, and let your worship be such as He appoints.\" In the Old Testament, the attire of the priesthood was itself an emblem of God's beauty and holiness. The worship system was one that was a feast to the people's senses.\n\nGod made everything beautiful (Eccl. 3:11), and He deserves the best that we can give Him. We ought to do all things well - our singing of the hymns, our reading of the Scriptures. However, it is not the spirit of beauty that God is concerned about but the spirit of holiness.\n\nOur worship should not be encumbered with lifeless ornamental formality. The towering cathedrals with stained glass windows, and the echoing chants of priests clothed in coloured vestments add a pomp and mystic beauty to the worship, but God's holiness must shine through the external beauty. His holiness is not seen in the bricks and mortars and the religious trappings. His holiness is seen in the lively stones which are His people. We are the ornaments of holiness that add to the beauty of worship.\n\nCHS: \"Our worship is spiritual, and the architecture of the house and the garments of the worshippers are matters of no importance; the spiritual beauty of inward purity and outward holiness being far more precious in the eyes of our thrice holy God.\" It is this which God seeks, and with this He will be pleased."

All these were done by the voice of the Lord (Ps. 29:3-9). The writer of Hebrews tells us that - \"The worlds were framed by the word of God\" (Heb. 11:3). The Lord spoke, and it was so. The Word of God is an unchangeable decree. Hence David said, \"The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever\" (v. 10).\n\nCHS: \"Power was displayed in the hurricane ... that power is promised to be the strength of the chosen. He who wings the unerring bolt, will give to His redeemed the wings of eagles; He who shakes the earth with His voice, will terrify the enemies of His saints, and give His children peace.\"\n\nBut the voice of the Lord, which reverberates in the heaven and on earth, also resonates in the hearts of individual persons. The Lord called Abraham. He spoke to Moses. He called Samuel and the prophets. He whispered to Elijah in a still small voice. Our Lord Jesus called Lazarus out of the grave. He called Saul of Tarsus. Our Lord is the good shepherd who \"calleth His own sheep by name\" (John 10:3).\n\n\"The Lord will give strength unto His people.\" Consider this blessed thought: The God of creation is also your God. The God Who rules the storms with devastating power is the God Who gives us strength. There is no reason to fear that His strength cannot support us.\n\nThe Lord will bless you with peace. There is nothing for us to fear in the tempest and trials of life. The Lord will cover us with His peace as we ride through the storms."

        "verse": "For His anger endureth but a moment; in His favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. (Psalm 30:5)",
        "text": "The title of this psalm - A Psalm and Song at the dedication of the house of David - hardly fits its content. The psalm is more a personal song of thanksgiving. There are two scenarios in the first six verses. First, it seemed that David had been restored from a serious physical illness. He had been brought to the very doors of death only to be spared, and David thanked the Lord for healing him and keeping him alive (vv. 2-3).\n\nSecond, it could also be that David had been spiritually sick; that he had sinned against the Lord. But now he praised the Lord for His righteous wrath was tempered with His gracious mercy.\n\nCHS: God's judgements are short, \"and they are removed as soon as real penitence sues for pardon and presents the great and acceptable sacrifice ...  God puts up His rod with great readiness as soon as its work is done; He is slow to anger and swift to end it.\"\n\nDavid compares God's wrath to a moment. Literally, it means a very short time - the time taken for a drop of tear to dry up. Man's sorrow is compared to the wayfaring stranger who stays for the night.\n\nGod's anger is but a moment, but His favour is life, and life more abundant and eternal. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning. We can count God's wrath in hours, but we measure His favour by eons.\n\nIn every break of morn, as we see the light of the morning sun peeking through the darkened horizon, we praise God for His gift of life and His favour. To be sure, the day will fade and night will set in again. It is only a foretaste. Yet there will come one day when we shall close our eyes for the night and awake to the eternal morn, and in the presence of the Sun of righteousness that shall never fade."

God was angry, yet in His favour was life. David wept in the night, but the morning brought joy and salvation. Are these changing circumstances part of David's changing fortunes? Are these the ebb and flow of life that is beyond our control? Absolutely not! God's hands are on the rudder as David confesses: \"Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness\" (Ps. 30:11).\n\nDavid ascribed his blessedness to the Lord's favour. Likewise, we must learn to regard each day of our lives as another page of evidence to our testimony of God's faithfulness.\n\nCHS: \"God takes away the mourning of His people; and what does He give them instead of it? Quiet and peace? ... a great deal more than that ...  He makes their hearts to dance at the sound of his name. He takes off their sackcloth. [He clothed them with gladness.] ... This is better than to wear garments of silk or cloth of gold ... Many a poor man wears this heavenly apparel wrapped around his heart ... such a man need not envy the emperor in all his pomp.\"\n\n\"Glory be to God\" is the song that David sang, and it should be the song of every believer because in Christ, we have been given a sense of full forgiveness, enriched with His spiritual nature, and filled with all His fullness. How can one sing in throes of pain and suffering? Well, turn back a few pages of your life, re- read the goodness of God in time past, recall His loving-kindness, and re-sing again the hymns of His faithfulness. And you will echo with David, \"I will give thanks unto Thee forever.\""

        "verse": "Into Thine hand I commit my spirit: Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. (Psalm 31:5)",
        "text": "David opens this psalm with a bold statement of trust. He follows up with several pictures of God as the basis for His trustworthiness. God is our Rock (vv. 2-3). He is our Fortress, and house of defence (v. 3).\n\nDavid makes two statements about God being his Rock. One is a prayer - \"Be Thou my strong Rock\" (v. 2); and the other is an affirmation - \"for Thou art my Rock\" (v. 3). The question is asked: if David knew that God was his Rock, why did he have to pray for it? Charles Spurgeon puts this as the logic of the heart. We know God to be many things because the Bible tells us so, but we do not know Him to be Who He really is until we take Him as a part of our personal experience. The Bible tells us that God is omnipotent; and if so, in times of weakness, we must pray for His strength. The Bible tells us that God is omnipresent; and if so, in times of loneliness, we must pray that He will be with us.\n\nFirst, we know God (Thou art my Rock); then we pray God to be what we know to be true about His relationship with us (Be Thou my Rock). Third, we must act upon what we know to be true about God - \"Into Thine hand I commit my spirit\" (v. 5a). You will recognise that these are the last words spoken by our blessed Saviour while He was on the cross.\n\nCHS: These words \"have been frequently used by holy men in their hour of departure ... Observe, the object of the good man's solicitude in life and death is not his body or his estate, but his spirit ... if this be safe, all is well ...  He commits it to the hand of his God ... All things are safe in Jehovah's hands.\"\n\nMany Christian martyrs had used the same words. John Hus was burned at the stake for defying the Pope. Before he was set aflame, the priest said to him, \"We commit your soul to the devil.\" Hus replied, \"I commit my spirit into Your hands, Lord Jesus Christ; my spirit which You have redeemed.\" The basis for this death-defying confidence is that our redemption has been accomplished by the God of Truth."

        "text": "Today's reading represents the second wave of David's troubles. He begins with a plea - \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord.\" What were his troubles? He was in the crosshairs of his enemies. There was a conspiracy to take his life. Furthermore, he was shunned by his neighbours and friends. His loved ones avoided him like the plague. He was left alone to bear the reproach of his enemies. David was consumed by grief. He was physically weak and emotionally drained. David was like a broken vessel. But he trusted in the Lord because \"Thou art my God!\" (v. 14).\n\nCHS: Despite the \"afflicting circumstances, David's faith maintained its hold ...  [David] proclaimed aloud his determined allegiance to Jehovah. He was no fair-weather believer, he could hold to his faith in a sharp frost, and wrap it about him as a garment fitted to keep out all the ills of time.\"\n\nDavid's confidence did not fail. He believed that God was his Father and Friend; and that God was still on the throne. If there was no one man who could help him, there was God! Was the Almighty David's last resort? No. He began the psalm declaring his trust in the Lord (v. 1). Jehovah was David's only resort. As he had committed his spirit to the Redeemer, so he now committed his times into the hands of the sovereign God.\n\nWhat a blessed assurance to know that our times are in God's hands. There can be no better plan than to know our Lord is the Captain of our souls.\n\nI know not, but God knows;\nOh, blessed rest from fear!\nAll my unfolding days\nTo Him are plain and clear.\nEach anxious, puzzled \"Why?\"\nFrom doubt or dread that grows,\nFinds answer in this thought:\nI know not, but He knows.\n(Annie Johnson Flint)"

        "text": "David writes in the first person until the nineteenth verse when he switches to the third person plural. In doing so, David encourages us to learn from his experience. God is good not only to David but to all who fear Him. The Lord was not only David's refuge, but He \"preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer\" (v. 23).\n\nGod's goodness is all-inclusive. His love extends to all. Our only appropriate response is to love Him in return.\n\nCHS: \"A most affecting exhortation, showing clearly the deep love of David to his God: there is the more beauty in the expression, because it reveals love towards a smiting God ... To bless him who gives is easy, but to cling to him who takes away is a work of grace ... If saints do not love the Lord, who will? Love is the universal debt of all the saved family: who would wish to be exonerated from its payment? Reasons for love are given, for believing love is not blind.\"\n\nWe do not love God by our own initiative. Our love for God is a response -  \"We love Him, because He first loved us\" (1 John 4:19). God, not we, is the initiator. God's love is directed towards the faithful, and He preserves them. In other words, God's love never ends. Hence, our love for God should neither be incidental nor fragmentary.\n\nOur Lord Jesus came to Peter and asked, \"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?\" (John 21:15). This question was repeated thrice. Peter, who had earlier denied the Lord, replied in muted tones, \"Lord; Thou knowest that I love Thee.\" As an exercise of self-examination, replace Simon's name in the verse with yours. What would your answer be?\n\nPeter's life was forever changed that day, and so should ours. We can never love God too much. Our love for God must be a life-long and life-changing commitment. Our love for Him must be an accurate reflection of His love for us."

        "text": "Although the occasion for this penitential psalm was not stated, David referred to an event in his life which left him spiritually dry (vv. 3-4). The anguish of his spirit and the guilt of his conscience were the result of his sin.\n\nDavid used three words for sin: transgression (rebellion), sin (to fall short), and iniquity (corruption). This three-fold description of the sinner does not leave him much hope. Indeed, there is no hope without God. However, He responds with three words to deal with man's sin: forgiven (lifted up), covered (overwhelmed), and not imputed (not counted). The point is that our sins are more than matched by God's grace. \"But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound\" (Rom. 5:20b).\n\nMy sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious tho't!\nMy sin, not in part but the whole,\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!\n(Horatio Spafford)\n\nThus, it makes perfect sense for the sinner to turn to God, and the outcome is the greatest beatitude in the Bible - \"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.\"\n\nCHS: \"Blessedness is not in this case ascribed to the man who has been a diligent law-keeper ...  but rather to a lawbreaker, who by grace most rich and free has been forgiven. Self-righteous Pharisees [men] have no portion in this blessedness. Over the returning prodigal ...  a full, instantaneous, irreversible pardon of transgression turns the poor sinner's hell into heaven, and makes the heir of wrath a partaker in blessing.\" Our sins are covered by Christ, \"whose atonement is the propitiation, the covering, the making an end of sin.\"\n\n\"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven.\" This is the state in which every man must find himself. But the blessing comes as a result of knowing who we are, as Augustine of Hippo wrote, \"The beginning of knowledge is to know oneself to be a sinner.\" It culminates in the knowledge that God forgives and covers and does not regard us according to our sins. He looks at the cross, and sees His Son, and we are accepted in the Beloved."

Call upon and draw near to God for He is our hiding place - the Refuge for our souls.

Rather, we are to emerge from the fountain of grace as new creatures in Christ, singing the praise of our blessed Saviour. The Lord Himself shall fill our lives with songs of deliverance.

The Lord sees all, but He Himself is not seen.\n\nMan's sight, on the other hand, is limited. We cannot see beyond our field of sight. And what we cannot see, we either disregard or fear. For this reason, some people do not consider the consequences of their sinful actions; whereas there are others who are trapped in inaction for fear of the consequences.\n\nTo the sons of men, the all-seeing God is indeed the One to be feared. The Lord sees everything. He sits on the throne of heaven as the all-knowing Judge, and He quietly observes the doings of man. He knows not only the works of our hands but also the thoughts and intents of our hearts.\n\nTo the God-fearing man, God is a source of consolation. \"Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy\" (v. 18).\n\nCHS: \"They who fear God need not fear anything else; let them fix their eye of faith on Him, and His eye of love will always rest upon them ...  Dost thou not hope in the mercy of God in Christ Jesus? Then the Father's eye is as much upon thee ... These gentle words, like soft bread, are meant for babes in grace, who need infants' food.\"\n\nThe Lord is not passive. The God of love is not indifferent.

To disarm the Philistines' mistrust, David pretended to be mad. This incident was a low point in David's life. But in the depths of David's despair, we see the depths of God's mercy and love. Charles Spurgeon gives an interesting outline to this psalm: verses 1-10 is a hymn, and verses 11-22 is a sermon.\n\nDavid begins with a personal adoration of God. \"I will bless ... my soul shall boast.\" CHS: \"What scope there is for holy boasting in Jehovah! His person, attributes, covenant, promises, works, and a thousand things besides, are all incomparable, unparalleled, matchless ...  he who writes these words of comment has nothing of his own to boast of, but much to lament over, and yet none shall stop him of his boast in God so long as he lives.\"\n\nPraising God should be instinctive to Christians. What we delight, we freely and openly proclaim. We praise God because we love and delight in Him. But our praises are not merely an expression of our delight in God - they are also an inherent part of our love for Him. Our love for and our praises of our Lord are not separate parts sewn together; rather, it should be a seamless garment interwoven with love and praise.\n\nDavid began with personal praise, but his boasting of the Lord could not be contained in himself. It was not long before he asked others to praise the Lord with him. Believers ought always to declare the goodness of God so that others may be confirmed in their trust in a faithful God. Corporate worship is instinctively natural for God's people.\n\nPraises that flow freely also overflow. The fragrance of our praises should also induce others to enter into the sanctuary of worship. Live so that Christ may be praised."

And you can know it too!\"\n\nCHS: \"Make a trial, an inward, experimental trial of the goodness of God. You cannot see except by tasting for yourself; but if you taste, you shall see ...  that the Lord is good ... There is a banquet [of spiritual blessings but] ... they will be all unknown to you except you make the blessings of grace your own, by a living, inward, vital participation in them ... Faith is the soul's taste; they who test the Lord by their confidence always find Him good.\"\n\nTo \"taste\" (v. 8) means \"to eat a little for the purpose of finding out what a thing is and passing judgement on it\". The wise woman \"perceiveth [tasted] that her merchandise is good\" (Prov. 31:18). In Psalm 34, it is used to describe the testing of our faith in God by experience.\n\nThere is really no way to know the promises of God except by living out His Word. The veracity of God's Word is proved by our obedience. The sureness of God's promises is proved by our faith in them. We will never know God's blessings until we prove His goodness by our submission.\n\nThere are people who think that problems arise when believers take the Word of God too literally. On the contrary, I believe that the problem with the church and individual Christians is that we do not take God's Word literally enough, especially His commands.\n\n\"All the promises of God in [Christ] are yea, and in Him Amen\" (2 Cor. 1:20).

There will be times when our hearts are broken, and occasions when our spirits are discouraged. We will be afflicted. But consider David's assurances: when we cry, the Lord hears (v. 15); when we are tested, the Lord delivers (v. 17); when our hearts are broken, the Lord draws near (v. 18); and when we are afflicted, He rescues.

The same Lord Who sends the afflictions will also recall them when His design is accomplished.\"\n\nDavid was a believing realist. He knew that \"man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble\" (Job 14:1). The reality of life is that this world is cursed. Many are the afflictions of the righteous. Our faith in God does not exempt us from the trials of life; in fact as Christians, we must expect more. \"If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you\" (John 15:20). \"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you\" (1 John 3:13).\n\nGenuine faith is a magnet for many afflictions, but genuine faith also sustains us. \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all\" (v. 19). Christian, count the number of afflictions in your life. Count the number of times God has delivered you. The fact that you are counting now is proof of God's mercy and goodness."

Many people cannot understand how these \"curses\" could be acceptable to God. We must look at the imprecatory psalms not as a call for private vengeance against our enemies, but a public vindication of God's righteousness. The Psalmist has identified himself with God and His cause that he regarded the enemies of God as his own, and he prays to God to justify Himself by judging those who deny Him and disobey His laws.\n\nWhen David prays, \"Plead my cause, O Lord,\" his prayer is right only if his cause is right. CHS: \"Every saint of God shall have this privilege: the accuser of the brethren shall be met by the Advocate of the saints. \"Fight against them that fight against me\" ... oppose Thy strength to their strength.\"\n\nThis is a three-part Psalm. David paints three pictures to portray this spiritual battle, of which the first is a petition for deliverance (vv. 4-10) - he calls on the Lord to come to his aid, picturing the Lord as a mighty warrior.\n\n\"Plead my cause, O Lord.\" To \"plead\" means to \"strive.\" David is asking the Lord to undertake his cause against those who had risen up against him. It is quite certain that David could not manage his own cause against his foes; and hence, he pleads with God to come to his aid. What a sure defense!\n\nOur battle is spiritual (Eph. 6:12), and our enemy is no less ruthless. He is the roaring lion and the accuser of our brethren (1 Pet. 5:8; Rev. 12:10). But we have our Lord Jesus as our Advocate; \"He is the propitiation for our sins\" (1 John 2:1-2). The battle has been fought and won, and all that remains is for us to call Him Who is able and willing to save."

When they were sick, David prayed for them. When they were in need, David provided for them. David loved them as a son would love his mother.\n\nCHS: \"The mother usually wins the deepest love, and her loss is most keenly felt: such was David's grief. How few professors [believers] in these days have such bowels of compassion ... [An irony because] under the gospel there should be far more tender love than under the law.\" If only believers were more loving and compassionate, we might be far more useful for the Lord.\n\n\"I behaved myself ... \" David walked uprightly in his dealings with his friends. By his conduct, David gave no cause for them to turn against him. But they did! Note the downward spiral of the ungrateful person. First, they rejoiced at David's adversities. Next, they exploited David's problems for their own gain. They came together not to oppose. Third, they were relentless in their attacks against David.\n\nDavid's friends were ungrateful. Ingratitude is a characteristic of spiritual immaturity. Babies do not appreciate what parents do for them. They have short memories. Their concern is not what you did for them a while ago, but what you are doing for them now. To the ungrateful person, the past is meaningless; the present is the opportunity to exploit more; and the future is the problem of the next generation.\n\nConversely, one who is mature and grateful will be deeply appreciative of those who laboured with and for one in the past. He is thankful for those who laboured in the present, and mindful to provide for those who will be labouring in the future."

The word \"wrongfully\" means \"falsely\", and it should properly describe David's enemies and not their rejoicing. Literally, David is saying that his \"false enemies\" are rejoicing over his adversities.\n\nWe know what false friends are, but what are false enemies? False enemies are those people who have no real cause to oppose David. They are those enemies who hate David for no reason. The only reason for their rejoicing was in David's predicament. His troubles became the material for their jokes. A Chinese saying goes: the enemy is one who rejoices at your calamities and delights in your crises.\n\nFurthermore, David's enemies \"wink with the eye\". This is an expression of malice. It is a gesture of mischief. The wink is used to disarm a person's guard, before stabbing him when he is caught off-guard.\n\nCHS: \"The winking of the eye was the low-bred sign of congratulation at the ruin of their victim, and it may also have been one of their scornful gestures as they gazed upon him whom they despised. To cause hatred is the mark of the wicked, to suffer it causelessly is the lot of the righteous.\"\n\nHatred against the Christian does not need a reason. It comes with being a child of God. Our Lord says, \"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me before it hated you\" (John 15:18). Our response is two-fold: first, that we should be mindful never to allow our conduct to justify that hatred; and \"if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf\" (1 Pet. 4:16)."

David's enemies had been successful in causing his downfall. They rejoiced at David's sufferings (vv. 15- 16). Now they rejoiced at his defeat as well (vv. 19, 24, 26). David's enemies were gloating at his pain, \"Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it\" (v. 21). What did David's enemies see? They saw the success of their false accusations.\n\nHowever, there is someone who saw and knew of the evil schemes. David prayed, \"This Thou hast seen, O Lord\" (v. 22). The Lord also saw. He knew the truth. He knew that David was falsely accused. And thus the Lord would plead David's cause and vindicate His servant. CHS: \"The day is coming when shouts of victory shall be raised by all who are on Christ's side, for the battle will turn, and the foes of truth shall be routed.\"\n\nDavid was not alone in his sufferings. There were others who recognised that David was the Lord's servant. CHS: \"We can have no nobler title than 'servant of God', and no greater reward than for our Master to delight in our prosperity. What true prosperity may be we are not always best able to judge. We must leave that in Jesus' hand; He will not fail to rule all things for our highest good.\"\n\nCan Christians pray for God's judgement upon our enemies? There are three important points to consider. First, such prayer is never for our private vengeance, but for the vindication of God; second, self-examination must precede such prayer. David asked the Lord to judge him (v. 24); and third, David asked the Lord to plead his cause, and left the matter in the hands of God. The Lord says, \"Vengeance is Mine; I will repay\" (Rom. 12:19b). How and when are all in the Lord's hands."

        "text": "What is the root problem of man? He has no fear of God. This describes the man who has neither reverence for God nor regard for His will. Such a man acts without any restraint from the laws of God. When man rejects God, he also loses the only true reference point for life. At the same time, he sets himself up as the final arbiter of morality - \"he flattereth himself in his own eyes\" (v. 2a).\n\nFrom that point on, it is a downward slide. In the first four verses, there are eleven descriptions of the ungodly man: he is a transgressor; he rejects God in his heart; he has no fear of God; he is proud; he is blind to his own sins; his words are deceiving; he rejects wisdom; he fails to do good; he thinks of evil; he sets himself to do evil; and he has no aversion to evil. Note the progression of evil from the rejection of God to ceasing to do good, then to doing evil and finally to hardening of his heart.\n\nThe wickedness of man is no match for the goodness of God. There is no man so wicked that God, by His sovereign will, cannot save. CHS: \"Divine mercy abides in its vastness of expanse, and matchless patience, all unaltered by the rebellions of man. When we can measure the heavens, then shall we bound the mercy of the Lord. Towards His own servants especially, in the salvation of the Lord Jesus, He has displayed grace higher than the heaven of heavens, and wider than the universe.\"\n\nDavid describes God's attributes in the superlatives. His mercy is in the heavens; His faithfulness reaches the clouds; His righteousness is like the mountains; His judgements reach into the deep - so that He might preserve His creation (vv. 5-6)."

The phrase means \"to be filled with water.\" It is the picture of a man who was thirsty and hungry but had drunk and eaten till he was utterly satisfied.\n\nHe shall be filled with God's pleasures (v. 8b). The word \"pleasure\" is \"eden\" in Hebrew. David was looking back to the days before the fall, when man's greatest pleasure was the fellowship he had with his Creator. This is the picture of reconciliation. To the righteous man, reverence to God is a delightful occupation.\n\nHe shall have life from the Fountain of life. CHS: \"From the Lord, as from an independent self-sufficient spring, all creature life proceeds, by Him it is sustained, through Him alone can it be perfected. Life is in the creature, but the fountain of it is only in the Creator. Of spiritual life, this is true in the most emphatic sense; 'it is the Spirit that quickeneth,''and we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God.'\"\n\nHe shall see light. The source of light is the Lord. The wicked man has lost his bearing. The righteous finds his by looking to the Lord. There is no other source of real light and truth but God. By looking to God, we know who God is and who we are. There are some people who change their ways when they see the light; but there are others who feel the heat and continue on their own paths.

But the strength and beauty of age is spiritual. We gradually lose the strength and beauty that is temporary so we'll be sure to concentrate on the strength and beauty that is forever.\"\n\nPsalm 37 is the beautiful testimony of a godly old man. Perhaps, David pens this as his final will and testament, and he leaves behind a wealth of spiritual lessons - truths that will bring us spiritual success and contentment.\n\nThe first step to God's formula of finding lasting contentment is to \"fret not ... neither be thou envious\" (v. 1). The grass may seem greener on the other side, but it will \"soon be cut down.\" The temporal nature of worldly wealth is nothing compared to the eternal inheritance that God has prepared for us. Moses understood this principle, and he chose \"to suffer affliction ...  than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season\" (Heb. 11:25).\n\nStep two: Trust in the Lord and do good. CHS: \"Faith cures fretting ... Faith has clearer optics to behold things as they really are ... True faith is actively obedient. Doing good is a fine remedy for fretting. There is a joy in holy activity which drives away the rust of discontent.\"\n\nStep three: Delight in the Lord (v. 4). This simply means the Lord becomes our number-one-desire. We worship Him not for the gifts that He has given, but above all for Who He is to us. When we are completely submerged in Him, then surely His desires shall be ours as well.\n\nStep four: Commit our way to the Lord (vv. 5-6). \"Commit\" has the idea of rolling a heavy burden from ourselves and laying it upon the Lord:\n\nRolled away, rolled away, rolled away.\nEv'ry burden of my heart rolled away.\nEv'ry sin had to go 'neath the crimson flow.\n\nEvery one of these steps is an imperative.

Even if they suffer, their consolations shall overtop [exceed] their tribulations. By inheriting the land is meant obtaining covenant privileges and the salvation of God. Such as are truly humble shall take their lot with the rest of the heirs of grace, to whom all good things come by a sacred birthright.\"\n\nWhat does it mean to be meek? There is a farcical organisation known as DOORMATS, which stands for \"Dependent Organisation of Really Meek And Timid Souls,\" and their motto is \"The meek shall inherit the earth, if that's okay with everybody.\"\n\nDoes being meek mean being a doormat? No. The meek person is one who knows himself to be poor in spirit. Moses was a meek man (Num. 12:3), but he was not always so (Exod. 2:12; Num. 20:11-12). But he was meek in that when he was maligned, he kept silent. His meekness was shown in his acceptance of what God had ordained, including his enormous disappointment of being shut out of the Promised Land.\n\nMeekness, for a child of God, means submitting to God knowing that it is the Lord Who orders all things. What He sends, we accept in faith even if it hurts, knowing that the Lord's will is perfect. It requires more strength, fortitude and faith to be meek.\n\nThe meek shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. Meekness produces peace because the meek person no longer struggles against circumstances and people for what seems to be his rights."

However, David's point is unmistakable; a man is good because he delights in the Lord.\n\nWhen a man delights in the Lord, his steps will be ordered by the Almighty; meaning that the course of his life will be guided by the Lord. A man whose life is ordered is assured of God's favour, but he is not exempted from trials. There will be times when he stumbles and falls.

Good men, as a rule, speak that which is to edifying, sound speech, religious conversation, consistent with the divine illumination which they have received.

Billy Sunday looked at her, and said, \"So is a shotgun, it blows everything to pieces in a few short seconds.\"\n\nDavid gives us another pearl of wisdom: the source of good speech is the heart.

Upright men are marvels of grace, and worth beholding ... The man of peace has an end of peace. Peace without end comes in the end to the man of God. His way may be rough, but it leads home.

What kind of \"the end\" depends on what you do in the present. The Christian race is not a 100-metre sprint where the starting can make the difference between a loser and a winner. Instead, the Christian race is a marathon, which calls not for a quick burst of speed but a persevering effort to the end.\n\nThe end of the righteous man is peace. The Hebrew word for peace (shalom) encompasses far more than its English equivalent. \"Peace\" is used in the Bible to describe a man who has complete well-being, physical as well as spiritual.

Soul sickness tells upon the entire frame; it weakens the body, and then bodily weakness reacts upon the mind. One drop of divine anger sets the whole of our blood boiling with misery ... No soundness and no rest are two sad deficiencies; yet these are both consciously gone from every awakened conscience until Jesus gives relief.\"\n\nSin wreaks its havoc not just on the sinner but also on those around him. A man sins, but the effects of his sin extend its deadly grasp to others. It is like a disease that spreads. In the 1300's a few Italian merchant ships returned from China carrying the bubonic plague. Within a few days, the deadly disease spread; and within five years, one third of Europe's population was wiped out.\n\nIf the psalm had ended at the eighth verse, it would have been depressing for the sinner. But in his sinful state, David also knew that God's ear was not deaf to his cries for mercy. This is the proper way to appeal to God. We can neither demand for mercy nor claim it, but we certainly can ask or cry for it. And those who cry to God earnestly and humbly will never go away from the throne of grace empty-handed."

The humble cry - \"Lord\" - acts like a key that opens the fountain of God's divine mercy that flows from the throne of grace.\n\nIt is not the eloquence of the lips but the contrition of the heart that impresses God. The best prayers are those spoken from a broken heart. It chimes like music, reaching to the courts of heaven.\n\n\"Lord, all my desire is before Thee.\" By this, David means that his desires are transparent to the Lord. The Lord knows David's brokenness, and He is the only One Who could heal and restore.\n\nCHS: \"Blessed be God, He reads the longings of our hearts; nothing can be hidden from Him; what we cannot tell Him He perfectly understands. The Psalmist is conscious that he has not exaggerated, and therefore appeals to heaven for a confirmation of his words. The good Physician understands the symptoms of our disease and sees the hidden evil which they reveal, hence our case is safe in His hands ... Sorrow and anguish hide themselves from the observation of man, but God spies them out. [There is] none more lonely than the broken-hearted sinner, yet hath he the Lord for his companion.\"\n\nHis faithfulness fails not; it meets each new day\nNew guidance for every new step of the way;\nNew grace for new trials, new trust for old fears,\nNew patience for bearing the wrongs of the years,\nNew strength for new burdens, new courage for old,\nNew faith for whatever the day may unfold;\nAs fresh for each need as the dew on the sod;\nOh, new every morning the mercies of God!\n(Annie Johnson Flint)"

But the only recourse for sin is humble confession.\n\nCHS: \"The slander of his enemies he repudiates, but the accusations of his conscience he admits. Open confession is good for the soul. When sorrow leads to hearty and penitent acknowledgment of sin it is blessed sorrow, a thing to thank God for most devoutly ... It is well not so much to bewail [express] our sorrows as to denounce the sins which lie at the root of them. To be sorry for sin is no atonement for it, but it is the right spirit in which to repair [go] to Jesus, Who is the reconciliation and the Saviour.\"\n\nThe concept of a man being \"sorry for sin\" is almost alien to the modern mind. The world's intention is to turn sin on its head and remove the sinner's personal responsibility for his sin. Today sin is often defined as a disease; an error in judgement; or even the result of freedom of choice, of youthful indiscretion, or of midlife crisis. Some people even describe sin as a necessary evil, only to realise that, as sin becomes more and more necessary, it also become less and less evil.\n\nWhat is sin? Susannah Wesley, the godly mother of Charles and John Wesley, gives this wise definition: \"If you would judge of the lawfulness or the unlawfulness of pleasure, then take this simple rule: Whatever weakens your reason, impairs the tenderness of your conscience, obscures your sense of God, and takes off the relish of spiritual things - that to you is sin.\"\n\nThere is nothing heavier than the burden of sin, but there is nothing sweeter than God's forgiving grace. 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9)."

        "text": "Psalm thirty-nine invites us to consider the meaning of life. What is the end of man's life? The Westminster Divines state eloquently that man's chief end (purpose of life) is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. The prerogative of glorifying and enjoying God is to know Him. Knowing God - Who He is and what He has done - puts us in the proper framework of knowing our end (the destination of life), and that includes the brevity and frailty of our lives.\n\nCHS: \"The Psalmist would know more of the shortness of life, that he might better bear its transient ills [present adversities], and herein we may safely kneel with him, uttering the same petition. That there is no end to its misery is the hell of hell; that there is an end to life's sorrow is the hope of all who have a hope beyond the grave ... They who see death through the Lord's glass, see a fair sight, which makes them forget the evil of life in foreseeing the end of life.\"\n\n\"Lord, make me to know mine end\" reveals David's impatience over God's apparent lack of help in his hour of need. Can it be fair that a life so brief be crowded with so much pain? Before we criticise David for his indulgence in self-pity, we must also examine our own hearts, and how prone we are to do the same.\n\nLook at the brevity of life this way: \"Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory\" (2 Cor. 4:16b-17). That life on earth is brief is our consolation for pain for we know it is only temporary; that life is brief makes it incumbent upon us to live life for the glory of God."

Beckett was known for his pessimism of the human condition. In one of his most famous play, Waiting for Godot, a man was waiting for another man (Godot), whom he did not know, and whose coming he was not sure. It was an uncertain and vain wait.\n\nThe sinner's life is just as futile without God. But by His sovereign grace, God comes into the sinner's life, removes the glitter, exposes his hopelessness, and shows him a better way.\n\nCHS: \"As the moth frets the substance of the fabric, mars all its beauty, and leaves it worn out and worthless, so do the chastisements of God discover to us our folly, weakness, and nothingness, and make us feel ourselves to be as worn out vestures, worthless and useless. Beauty must be a poor thing when a moth can consume it and a rebuke can mar it. All our desires and delights are wretched moth-eaten things when the Lord visits us in His anger ... He [man] is unsubstantial as his own breath, a vapour which appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away.\"\n\nIf life is brief, and its achievements are worthless, how then shall we live? This is what Amy Carmichael prayed when she remembered that homeless lady she saw as a young girl: \"My God, who has committed to my care Thy ransomed one (that lady) lest I be scattered here and there and she be gone. Give me to hold me firmly to my trust; let all that would distract me be as dust. 'Thy life for hers' - O solemn, urgent word. Lest I forget, my sense of values waver, or be blurred, or overset by other things, take me and purge and bend each power and purpose to one single end. Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth Thee, O Lord, my God. Give clearness, lest some by-way tangle me. Where Christ hath trod, there would I tread, nor ever turn aside, lest she be missing for whom Christ hath died.\""

The mud must have been so terribly thick that it took 30 men to pull Jeremiah out of the dungeon. David was also in a horrible pit. The pit, however, is merely a picture of some debilitating sin in his life - his sin with Bathsheba; his unholy alliance with the Philistines; his years as a fugitive of Saul's court. Whatever they might be, David could not pull himself out of his miry mess; he could only cry to God and wait. The Lord answered.\n\nCHS: \"The Redeemer's work is done. He reposes on the firm ground of His accomplished engagement [finished work] ... What a comfort to know that Jesus our Lord and Saviour stands on a sure foundation in all that He is and does for us ...

In such a situation, help must come from outside. When we cry, God hears, and He dispatches His help, not with a multitude of men but only His Son; not with temporal relief but with the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit. When God helps, He does not merely lift us out from the pit. He sets our feet upon the rock and directs our going. And as an added measure of His love, He gives us a new song to sing His praise."

        "text": "\"Idelight to do Thy will.\" This should be the desire of every born-again Christian. But how does one fulfill that desire? How can we know God's will? How should we do God's will? Answer: the will of God is found in His law, and doing the will of God is the same as obeying the Word of God.\n\nCHS: \"Herein is the essence of obedience, namely, in the soul's cheerful devotion to God: and our Lord's obedience, which is our righteousness, is in no measure lacking in this eminent quality. Notwithstanding His measureless griefs, our Lord found delight in His work, and for 'the joy that was set before Him He endured the cross, despising the shame' ... No outward, formal devotion was rendered by Christ; His heart was in His work, holiness was His element, the Father's will His meat and drink.\"\n\nThe Pharisees observed the letter of the law. But while they kept the law's minutiae, they erred in one vital point - they had the wrong motivation. They kept the law, but they did not love it. They obeyed the law, but it was a burden. To delight in doing God's will is more than a mechanical response. It is not just about doing, but also about the delight that accompanies it. Where there is no heart, there can be no delight; and without delight, there can be no acceptance before God.\n\nThe only way to delight in the law of God is to submerge ourselves in it. It is not easy to carry two gallons of water over our heads because of the weight of the water. But when we are completely submerged in a pool of water, we do not feel the weight of water over us because we are in it. Likewise, when we delight in Christ - the One Who fulfills the law - we also delight in His law."

In dark days we cannot rest upon the supposed merit of almsgiving, but still the music of memory brings with it no mean solace when it tells of widows and orphans whom we have succoured [helped], and prisoners and sick folks to whom we have ministered.\" The promise is not that the merciful person will have no trouble, but that his mercy will be compensated by the Lord in full and even some more. For the man who considers others, the Lord will consider him.\n\nThere are seven things that God will do for the one who is merciful: He delivers him from trouble; He preserves; He keeps him alive; He blesses; He will not forsake him to the enemy; He strengthens; and He restores - a seven-fold return for a kind thought, or deed, or word."

David was cast down and debased, and the Lord raised him up and repaid his enemies (v. 10). David was disowned and defeated, but the Lord showed him favour and silenced his enemies (v. 11).

This means that the writer was heading east away from Jerusalem.\n\nWhat was the Psalmist doing away from the holy city? Perhaps he belonged to that group of people who were being deported from Jerusalem. Away from home and God, the Psalmist compared himself to a deer that thirsted from the chase of the predator. The question that seized his mind was: \"When can I worship God again?\"\n\nCHS: \"He who loves the Lord loves also the assemblies wherein His name is adored ...

If the righteous should forsake God and turn to idols, would God be silent? Shall He not know?

Is God asleep? Has He forgotten? (vv. 23-24). These are questions of which the Psalmist receives no answers. He could only humbly trust in God's loving-kindness. We must know the love of God the same way.

As we read the psalm, we have to imagine the proceedings of such a wedding - the music that fills that cathedral, the sights and scents of the flowers, the glory of the bridegroom-king, and the purity of his bride.\n\nThe identity of the royal couple is not revealed, but the Psalmist is also using the occasion to look ahead and heavenward to the eternal King Who will return for His purchased Bride. \"I will greatly rejoice in the Lord ... for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation ... with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations\" (Isa. 61:10-11).\n\nThe glories that he saw were enough to inspire the King's poet to write, \"My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.\" But the words that come from the lips and flows from the pen are only as good as the heart. CHS: \"Heartless hymns are insults to heaven ... A good heart will only be content with good thoughts. Where the fountain is good, good streams will flow forth ... It is a sad thing when the heart is cold with a good matter, and worse when it is warm with a bad matter, but incomparably well when a warm heart and a good matter meet together.\"\n\nThe word \"inditing\" means to \"boil over\"; the idea is that the heart is filled with emotions of love to overflowing. In musical performances, the audience will know whether a singer is producing sounds mechanically or if his heart is also involved. When the heart is engaged, the work will have an added quality. That is how our work for the Lord should be  -  a heart-work."

The eighth verse inspired the hymn \"Ivory Palaces\". The composer, Henry Barraclough, was the pianist for Evangelist Wilbur Chapman; and based his lyrics on Chapman's sermon outline. The refrain from the hymn reads:\n\nOut of the ivory palaces,\nInto a world of woe,\nOnly His great eternal love\nMade my Savior go.\n\nThis is the sacrifice and grace of our Lord Jesus for sinners; that \"though He was rich, yet for your [our] sakes He became poor, that ye [we] through His poverty might be rich\" (2 Cor. 8:9; Phil. 2:6-7). What does the Lord require of us? \"So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty: for He is thy Lord; and worship thou Him\" (v. 11). As His redeemed, we are \"to love Him, and to serve the Lord [our] God with all [our] heart and with all [our] soul\" (Deut. 10:12). Anything less than whole-hearted love would be ingratitude.\n\nCHS: \"Whole-hearted love is the duty and bliss of the marriage state ... The Church [Christians] must forsake all others and cleave to Jesus only, or she [we] will not please Him nor enjoy the full manifestation of His love. What less can He ask, what less may she [we] dare propose than to be wholly His? ... No great [true] and lasting revival of religion can be granted us till the professed lovers of Christ [we] prove their [our] love by coming out from an ungodly world.\"\n\nOur blessed Saviour stepped out of the ivory palace into a sinful world to save us from it, and we who are bound for the ivory palace must forsake all else to make Him our only object of desire."

She is not only splendidly dressed in gold, but she is also \"all glorious within\" (v. 13). \"Within\" can be understood in two ways. Firstly, it speaks of the bride's inner graces (1 Pet. 3:3-4); and secondly, it describes her private testimony, meaning to say that she is glorious even within the privacy of her own home, when no one is looking.\n\nWithout a doubt, the bride in this Psalm is the picture of the Church - the bride of Christ. The Church must be glorious not just in outward piousness but also inward holiness. And Christians must shine not just in the midst of a thousand other lights, but in the darkened world. We are to be \"blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye [we] shine as lights in the world\" (Phil. 2:15).\n\nBy this testimony of holiness, the name of our Lord Jesus will be made known and remembered forever. CHS: \"His name is His fame, His character, His person; these are dear to His people ... Names renowned in one generation have been unknown to the next, but the laurel [name] of Jesus shall ever be fresh, His renown [fame] ever new. God will see to this; His providence and His grace shall make it so. The fame of Messiah is not left to human guardianship; the Eternal [God] guarantees it. All down the ages the memories of Calvary shall glow with inextinguishable light ... [and nothing shall] dim the glory of the Redeemer's fame.\"\n\nFor now, it seems that the glory of the church is dimmed and the praises of God are somewhat muted, but the glory is not seen because the world is blind, and the praises not heard because it is deaf. But happy are we who join in the happy song on earth; happier still when we see our Saviour face to face."

This \"activity\" is not as easy to do in our fast-paced life; for the go-getter, it is impossible to be still. Idlers take \"be still\" to mean doing nothing. To the pious ones, it means to live a contemplative and reclusive life; to the fatalists, it is to be resigned to their fate. The phrase \"be still\" means \"to let the hands down\" but not for reasons of indolence or impotence; but trust.\n\n\"Be still, and know that I am God\" means to \"trust God\" because He is the One Who alone is able to cause \"the wars to cease\" and calms the storms in our lives."

One day all knees will bow, and all tongues will confess. The critical distinction is the location at which we make this confession: will it be in the torments of hell or before the throne of holiness? The homage we pay, will it be in reverence or in regret? And the confession of our lips, will it be songs of joy or the groans of judgement?"

The Psalmist was profuse in his praise because he saw that the Lord had chosen to reside among His own people. It harked back to the time when the children of Israel were travelling to the Promised Land, and the Lord said, \"And let [the people] make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them\" (Exod. 25:8).\n\nThe beauty and joy are not inherent in the physical environs of Mount Zion; it is surrounded by higher mountains offering more scenic views. But Zion was beautiful and she became the \"joy of the whole earth\" simply because the Lord was there. Zion was beautiful because of the beauty of the Lord. One writer compares this to the kenosis [self-humiliation] of the Old Testament - the beauty of the Lord's condescension to dwell with His people.\n\nCHS: God is great in His city, \"and should be greatly praised there. If all the world beside renounced Jehovah's worship, the chosen people in His favoured city should continue to adore Him, for in their midst and on their behalf His glorious power has been so manifestly revealed ... [Likewise,] in the church, the Lord is to be extolled though all the nations rage against Him. Jerusalem was the peculiar abode of the God of Israel ... the centre of prescribed worship, and even thus is the church the place of divine manifestation.\"\n\nHowever, there is an even greater condescension. Jehovah Who inhabits eternity will also dwell with the man who \"is of a contrite and humble spirit\" (Isa. 57:15). Every repentant sinner is an earthen vessel that holds the treasure, even \"the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ\" (2 Cor. 4:6-7)."

Now in their worship, they were thinking of the Lord's loving-kindness (v. 9).\n\nHaving seen, heard, and contemplated the Lord's goodness, it would be remiss for His people to keep these blessed thoughts to themselves without publishing them. God's people must seize every opportunity to speak of His goodness.

The idea is that the Lord will be our guide; that He will never forsake us; and that He will accompany us faithfully to the end even unto death.\n\nWe need nothing more for this life than this confident assurance that we have the Eternal God as our guide, and that He will never leave us nor forsake us. When our lives and decisions reflect that whole-hearted commitment to, and our confidence in our Saviour, we are making a bold declaration of faith to our children, and this will surely leave a lasting impression upon the hearts of the next generation."

One commentator coined the term \"affluenza\" and defines it as the heart disease of wanting more without assessing the true value of \"things\" in life. Materialism/covetousness, it seems, remains a persistent and universal problem for Christians.\n\nThe foolishness of trusting in riches comes from the obvious truth that it cannot save a man from death. Leo Tolstoy told the story of a rich farmer who wanted more land. One day, the man came to know about an unusual offer for land. For 1,000 rubles, he could buy all the land he could walk in one day, but he had to be back at his starting point by dusk. The farmer was walking before sunrise, and by midday, he was tired, but he kept going. Soon the man realised that his greed had taken him too far beyond the starting point and he quickened his steps to get back on time. The man staggered across the line just before the sun disappeared, and he collapsed and died from sheer exhaustion. The rich farmer's servant dug a hole six feet by three feet for his shallow grave. The title of Tolstoy's story was: How much land does a man need?\n\nCHS: \"Poor fools, to be content with such a rotten confidence ...

The sin was especially egregious for several reasons: first, David was already married with several wives, but because of his covetousness, he had taken another man's only wife; second, that man was Uriah, David's trusted general; and third, to cover up his sin, David had arranged for Uriah to be killed on the battlefield. However, David's worst sin was that he had despised the commandment of the Lord and had \"given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme\" (2 Sam. 12:14).\n\nDavid's sin was in itself a wicked act not just against Uriah, but against God.

He uses three verbs to describe this cleansing - purge, wash, and blot (vv. 7, 9).\n\n\"Purge me with hyssop.\" Hyssop is a small plant that is found growing out of the crevices of walls (1 Kings 4:33). In the Old Testament, the hyssop was used as a brush to sprinkle blood. Hyssop thus symbolized ceremonial cleansing under the Law (Lev. 14). The first record of its use in the Bible is at the first Passover (Exod. 12:22).\n\nDavid, however, was not appealing to the Law or God's justice; neither was he counting on the rituals. David knew that under the law, there was no forgiveness for his sins, so he wisely asked for God's mercy. David was alluding to that great deliverance of God when He passed over the houses and saved the first born of Israel. When he asked God to purge him with hyssop, David was asking God to pass over him on the basis of the blood of Another who was innocent. The efficacy of this cleansing is not found in the blood of animal offerings (v. 16), but in that of the perfect Lamb of God. \"Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold ... but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot\" (1 Pet. 1:18-19).\n\nCHS: \"Nothing but blood can take away my blood-stains, nothing but the strongest purification can avail to cleanse me. Let the sin-offering purge my sin.

Despite his sins, it was his faith that allowed him to see in the blood sufficiency to purge them away. Despite his innate corruption (v. 5), David was able to rejoice in the hope of perfect purity in his heart (v. 10)."

He confesses his sins (vv. 1-4); he pleads for cleansing (vv. 5-9); and he prays for restoration of fellowship (vv. 10-13).\n\nDavid asks God to create in him a clean heart (v. 10). He was not asking for an old heart made better but an altogether new one. The word \"create\" means to cause something that was not there before to exist (Gen. 1:1). It is creation ex nihilo. In other words, David was asking for nothing but a miracle.\n\nTo have \"a clean heart\" means that David's heart which had been corrupted is now made right; that his heart may be pure, his affections holy, and his desires undefiled. This creation of a new heart could only come by the power of the Creator.\n\nCHS: \"Salvation is a marvellous display of supreme power; the work in us as much as that for us is wholly of Omnipotence. The affections must be rectified first, or all our nature will go amiss. The heart is the rudder of the soul, and till the Lord take[s] it in hand, we steer in a false and foul way.\"\n\nSalvation is the act of grace by which the sinner's heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ. Sanctification is the necessary next step of salvation, and the only way by which the redeemed sinner can keep his heart clean is to be in the presence of the Almighty (v. 11). Having understood the impact of sin upon his heart and the consequent separation from God, David acknowledges that without God, he cannot live a holy life."

Mere external offerings, however costly, will never impress God. The sinner's heart is what He truly desires. David understood that true religion is the faith of the heart, and the love for God that flows from it.\n\nFor the sacrifice to have meaning and value, it must be accompanied by a broken and contrite heart. CHS: \"'A broken heart' is an expression implying deep sorrow, embittering the very life ... A heart crushed is a fragrant heart. Men contemn [despise] those who are contemptible in their own eyes, but the Lord seeth not as man seeth. He despises what men esteem, and values that which they despise. Never yet has God spurned a lowly, weeping penitent ...  Bullocks and rams God desires not, but contrite hearts He seeks after.\"\n\nIn the covenant of grace, where the sacrifice has been made on our behalf by our blessed Saviour, the brokenness and contrition of the heart is the mark of true evangelical repentance. The truly repentant sinner will never boast of what he has done or what he will do - only what Christ has done for him.\n\nDavid was wise to come to God with a broken heart for what value is there in a sinful heart? It is the broken heart that God takes and moulds for His use.\n\nThe Lord will happiness divine\nOn contrite hearts bestow;\nThen tell me, gracious God, is mine\nA contrite heart, or no?\nOh make this heart rejoice or ache;\nDecide this doubt for me;\nAnd if it be not broken, break - \nAnd heal it, if it be!\n(William Cowper)"

Paul warns about the love of money being \"the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows\" (1 Tim. 6:10). The evil of covetousness will lead a man away from God, and the errors of his ways will lead him to the evil of covetousness.\n\nThe wicked man boasts in his own abilities, but the godly is like a green olive tree in the house of God. The olive tree is one of the hardiest trees. It may last for hundreds of years, and it thrives even in the most severe summer droughts. The olive tree is a symbol for perseverance and productivity. What more the olive tree that is in the house of God and nourished by Him. This is the picture of the righteous man, his circumstances notwithstanding, he trusts in the mercy of God and remains fruitful for Him."

        "text": "Psalms 14 and 53 are almost identical. That a psalm is repeated marks its importance, and the need for our attention. Spurgeon suggested that David wrote the fourteenth Psalm when he was young and the fifty-third when he was old, but the lesson remains the same. If our age advanced from 14 to 53, we shall find the doctrine of this psalm more evident than in our youth.\n\nThe blind says in his heart that there is no God. The implication is that what he sees indicates otherwise. A medical expert on congenital blindness said that to give back sight to a congenitally blind person is more the work of an educator than of a surgeon. For such a person to meaningfully see, he needs more than the power of sight. He also needs to configure his mind and rightly interpret what he sees.\n\nLikewise, it is not enough for a man to know that there is a God. He must also rightly interpret and apply the reality of God in his life - his relationship with God; and his sins in light of what God says about them.\n\nThe problem with the fool is that he is spiritually blind and morally indifferent. He looks and sees not, and so he acts as if there is no God. Tragically for the sinner, he is not the judge of what is right and true. On the contrary, he is the accused standing in the court of the righteous Judge. And His verdict is conclusive: \"there is none that doeth good, no, not one.\"\n\nIs there hope then for the sinner? CHS: \"The Lord did not look for great grace, but only for sincerity and right desire, but these He found not. He saw all nations ... and all hearts in all men ... but He saw neither a clear head nor a clean heart among them all ... The fallen race of man, left to its own energy, has not produced a single lover of God or doer of holiness, nor will it ever do so.

But again David's whereabouts were reported to Saul by the Ziphites (1 Sam. 23:19-20). Thus, Saul was able to move against David. The Ziphites betrayed David a second time when he was hiding in the hills of Hachilah (1 Sam. 26:1).\n\nIt seems David could not even find a hiding place in the wilderness. So David looked to the One Who is his sure refuge and faithful friend. David's prayer brings to mind Joseph Scriven's well-known hymn.\n\nHave we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged; take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a Friend so faithful Who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness; take it to the Lord in prayer.\n\nCHS: \"The reigning Lord, the great Adonai is in the camp [with David] ...

It is a great mercy to have some friends left us, but a greater mercy still to see the Lord among them ... Our friends stand for nothing till the Lord sets Himself as a great unit in the front of them.\"\n\nIt is good to have friends to rally around us in difficult times. Gideon had 300 men when he battled the Midianites. David had 600 men with him. Daniel had only three in Babylon. The number of friends, however, is inconsequential, when the Lord is there to help me and uphold those who comfort me.

He did not have the wings of a dove; and even if he did, he could not fly above the storm. Like David, there are times when you may have thought of leaving it all behind and getting away from it all, and hoping you will find rest somewhere else.\n\nBut there are two things to consider before you are tempted to leave it all behind too. First, no one can leave it all behind especially if it is a problem that you carry in your heart. No matter where you go, that heart problem goes with you. Second, what is rest to you? The Bible reminds us that rest is not a place on a map, but the presence of God in your heart (Phil. 4:7), and as the hymn reminds us, there is no better refuge from the storm than to be near to our Lord.\n\nThere is a place of quiet rest,\nNear to the heart of God.\nA place where sin cannot molest,\nNear to the heart of God.\n(Cleland McAfee)"

To compound David's grief, the betrayer was David's equal, meaning to say that he was David's spiritual mate. This was a person with whom David had shared his heart and mind. They were brothers in the Lord, had prayed for one another and had worshipped together; the spiritual bond was supposedly stronger than any ties of natural friendship.\n\nOne particular person came to mind - Ahithophel. He was David's advisor till he switched sides and aided Absalom in his conspiracy against David (2 Sam. 15:31).\n\nCHS: \"Religion had rendered their intercourse [friendship] sacred, they had ... communed on heavenly themes. If ever any bonds ought to be held inviolable, religious connections should be.

It is pride and blind courage for Christians to go about life without fear. However, it is also foolish to let fear paralyse you into inaction.\n\nFear is one of these things that is designed to make us feel that we need a God, and to lead us to Him. It is better for man to confess his fear and trust in God than it is for him to fight his fear and trust in himself.\n\nDavid was afraid of the Philistines in Gath, but he reminded us that the time of fear is also the time for faith; when you are afraid of what man will do to you, it is the most opportune time to trust in God. \"The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe\" (Prov. 29:25)."

This psalm, as with the preceding one, begins with David's prayer for God's mercy, but with a big difference.\n\nIn the fifty-sixth psalm, David prays for God's mercy because of the oppression of his enemies (Ps. 56:1). In Psalm 57, David prays for God's mercy because he trusts in the Lord. The difference is that David was no longer hiding from his enemies - he was hiding in the Lord.

[He was resolved to trust, serve, and to praise God] ... It is surely well with thee, if thy once roving heart is now firmly fixed upon God and the proclamation of His glory.\"\n\nA fixed heart is an established heart. David's heart was firm and steadfast. His heart was firm and decided. He did not waver in his purpose. He did not doubt God's mercy or goodness. Even when he was standing in the midst of trouble, he was standing firm.\n\nA fixed heart is also a prepared heart. When Joshua wanted to build a memorial of stones, he called \"the twelve men, whom he had prepared\" (Josh. 4:4). When Samuel led in the revival of Israel, he asked the people to put away the idols and \"prepare [their] hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him only\" (1 Sam. 7:3).\n\nBut a fixed heart is more than just a man's resolute determination. David's heart was not fixed upon the strength of his mind or the tenacity of his will. His fixed heart was in response to God's faithfulness. Because God is faithful, there is every reason for David to be faithful to God's faithfulness. Because God's heart is ever tender towards the righteous, therefore there is every reason for our hearts to fix upon His love in every situation in life."

The word \"prevent\" means to \"go before\". The omniscient God sees in the future and He sends forth His mercy ahead of us so that in every situation His all-sufficient grace will be equal to the task.\n\nHow blessed it is to know that the Lord not only marches with us into life's battle, but that He also marches ahead of us. How blessed it is to trust in the Lord of hosts Who is not only our defence but also our victory."

Besides, if God nips every sin in the bud, the righteous will never know what it is to be \"the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation\" (Phil. 2:15).\n\nCHS: \"To sweep away the plotters all at once were to end the great drama of retribution too abruptly. Let the righteous be buffeted a little longer, and let the boasting oppressor puff and brag through his little hour, it will help keep Israel in mind of the Lord's justice ... It were a pity for good men to be without detractors, seeing that virtue shines the brighter for the foil of slander [in affliction]. Enemies help to keep the Lord's servants awake. A lively, vexatious devil is less to be dreaded than a sleepy, forgetful spirit which is given to slumber.\"\n\nSecond, God allows evil to rear its ugly head so that it may serve as a solemn reminder to the righteous; lest we forget the Life on Calvary that was given for our sakes.\n\nKing of my life, I crown Thee now - Thine shall the glory be;\nLest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow, Lead me to Calvary.\nLest I forget Gethsemane, Lest I forget Thine agony;\nLest I forget Thy love for me, Lead me to Calvary.\n(Jennie Hussey)"

        "text": "The historical background to the sixtieth psalm is found in 2 Sam. 8:1-14. This lament psalm was composed at a time when David was beginning to enjoy some success in establishing his kingdom. In the midst of victory, there were disappointing setbacks and troubles which caused David to think that God was angry and had abandoned them (v. 1).\n\nDavid described the troubles as earthquakes that shook the land. His plea to God to \"heal the breaches\" implies that there were perhaps internal strife and discontent among his own people. Internal disunity poses a greater threat than external foes. Solomon says that \"a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city\" (Prov. 18:19a), and the work of the Gospel is often grounded by a few contentious members.\n\nHow does disunity arise? The problem often lies in human envy and pride. Disunity in the church is caused by sinners idolising other sinners; discord arises because believers regard men's private opinions as on par with God's revealed truth. The only antidote for disunity is to look unto our Lord Jesus and to rally around the banner of God's truth.\n\nCHS: \"The Lord has given us the standard of the gospel, let us live to uphold it, and if needful die to defend it. Our right to contend for God, and our reason for expecting success, are found in the fact that the faith has been once committed to the saints, and that by the Lord Himself.\"\n\nGodly Christians are God-fearing. Those who fear Him will also have a holy hatred for schism. As members of the body of believers, we must \"stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together [not against one another] for the faith of the gospel\" (Phil. 1:27b). The church will be for the better when believers learn to march behind the banner of God's truth."

These places were a reminder of God's past faithfulness as well as a promise of His future blessings. God promised that He would give David the land - a covenant that He had made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But who would help David, and how would the victory be achieved? Answers: God and his faith in Him.\n\nCHS: God, \"help us to overcome the disasters of civil strife and foreign invasion; save us from further incursions from without and division within ...  We have painfully learned the utter impotence of armies, kings, and nations without Thine help. Our banners trailed in the mire have proven our weakness without Thee but ... [victory is sure] now that Thou hast come to our rescue.\"\n\nOur help is in God alone. Man's good intentions and temporal aid may help to lighten the load, but true and lasting help must come from above. It is by the grace of God that we are able to gather strength for life's battle. Our help is in God alone, and that is why we must, as David did, ask the Lord in faith.\n\nHis banner over us is love,\nOur sword the Word of God.\nWe tread the road the saints above\nWith shouts of triumph trod.\nBy faith, they like a whirlwind's breath,\nSwept on o'er ev'ry field.\nThe faith by which they conquered death\nIs still our shining shield.\n(John Yates)\n\nIt is faith in God that is the victory that overcomes the world! Biblical faith is neither blind optimism nor simply positive thinking - it is the believing and doing of God's Word. Biblical faith is also not leaving it all to God - while the Lord sends His help, we must do valiantly (v. 12)."

The whole convention was beset with gloom as most of the delegates were businessmen, and they had lost a great deal of money in the economic downturn. Also present was Erastus Johnson who wrote the words to the hymn \"The Rock that is Higher than I.\" William Fischer composed the music, and the hymn became the signature hymn of the convention:\n\nOh! Sometimes the shadows are deep,\nAnd rough seems the path to the goal,\nAnd sorrows, sometimes how they sweep - \nLike tempests down over the soul.\nO then to the Rock let me fly!\nTo the Rock that is higher than I.\n\nDavid was caught in a difficult predicament when he cried unto the Lord. His plea revealed that he was fully aware of his own failures and frailty. His strength was waning; he was drowning in a sea of troubles; and he needed to find a place of refuge for his weary soul. The only place that he could plant his feet was upon the Rock that was higher than he was.\n\nCHS: \"I see Thee to be my refuge, sure and strong; but alas! I am confused, and cannot find Thee; I am weak, and cannot climb thee. Thou art so steadfast, guide me; Thou art so high, uplift me ... A Saviour would have been of no use to us if the Holy Spirit had not gently led us to Him, and enabled us to rest upon Him.\"\n\nThe Christian's comfort is that we can never be so far from God that He could not hear our prayers, and there is no heart so depressed that God's presence cannot cheer. Like David, even when we think that we are at the end of the earth, when we cry out to Him, He will hear."

        "text": "In this psalm, David's words show that he trusts God exclusively. This absolute trust is very evident in the Hebrew text - 6 of the 12 verses begin with the Hebrew word for \"alone\" or \"only\" (vv. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9). The emphasis of alone is important to our understanding of the Christian faith. God alone is David's object of faith. God alone and no one else is David's help. God alone and always is David's trust. As one Puritan preacher says, \"They trust not God at all who trust not Him alone.\"\n\nIn describing God only as his Rock (vv. 2, 6), David was drawing upon his own experience. He knew that while the rocks provided some momentary protection, it was God Who was his real refuge. Hence he said, \"Trust in Him at all times.\"\n\nCHS: \"Faith is an abiding duty, a perpetual privilege. We should trust when we can see, as well as when we are utterly in the dark ... God at all times deserves our confidence. We at all times need to place our confidence in Him. A day without trust in God is a day of wrath, even if it be a day of mirth.\"\n\nTrusting God is not our holding on to Him. True faith is knowing that God holds on to us. It is not the strength of our will but the submission of our heart. To trust God, as David says, is to pour out your heart before Him. The idea is to entrust God with all our heart's sorrows, fears and desires. There is no sorrow that He could not relieve; no fear that He could not deliver; and no desire that He could not satisfy. It is this confidence that invites us to cast all our care upon Him, for He cares for us (1 Pet. 5:7)."

But where are the wise and noble in the eyes of God? In the eyes of God, the best of man is at best a man.\n\nAlexander Maclaren translates the ninth verse as \"Only vanity are the sons of the lowly, a lie are the sons of the lofty.\" CHS: \"Men of low degree are only vanity, nothing more. They are many and enthusiastic, but they are not to be depended on; they are mobile as the waves of the sea, ready to be driven to and fro by any and every wind; they cry 'Hosanna' today, and \"Crucify Him\" tomorrow ... Men of high degree are a lie. We gain little by putting our trust in the aristocracy [elite] ... How wretched is that poor man who puts his trust in princes. The more we rely upon God, the more shall we perceive the utter hollowness of every other confidence.\"\n\nDavid had been at both ends of the social strata; he was a poor shepherd and a fugitive before he became king. He had seen life at both ends, so he could declare with certainty that the life a man has without God - whether he is poor or rich - is total futility. When they are measured, they are always found wanting, and lighter than vanity. The lesson for us is that we should neither fear nor idolise man because there is nothing that man can do to us to keep us away from God. Conversely, there is also nothing he can do to us to bring us to Him. Only Christ is man's hope."

        "text": "The title of this psalm puts David in the wilderness of Judah. There were two periods in David's life that he was in the wilderness - when he was fleeing from Saul, his king; and when he was fleeing from Absalom, his son. In both cases, David's life was in peril (v. 9). Being driven from Jerusalem and the temple explains David's longing for God.\n\nDavid yearns for fellowship with the Lord like the wanderer who thirsts for water after days in the desert. But David seeks more than just the spiritual water that could quench his parched soul - he seeks the very fountain of the soul. Note David's claim (Thou art my God) and therefore also his desire (my soul thirsteth for Thee).\n\nCHS: \"Possession breeds desire. Full assurance is no hindrance to diligence, but is the mainspring of it ... It is with ardent desire that I [David] seek[s] after Him whom I [he] know[s] to be my [his] own ... He will not wait for noon or the cool eventide; he is up at cockcrowing [dawn] to meet his God. Communion with God is so sweet that the chill of the morning is forgotten, and the luxury of the couch is despised.\"\n\nDavid would seek God as the first thing in the day. God first in his plans and purposes, God first in all things, God first in his thoughts, God first in his desires and God first in his life is Solomon's advice to the young person, \"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth\" (Eccl. 12:1a).\n\nThe early seeking is not merely a reference to the time of the day but it also describes the supreme desire of the seeker. He who truly seeks God seeks for Him at the earliest opportunity and seeks with passion. Jonathan Edwards writes that \"there is no true religion where there is no religious affection ... If the great things of religion are rightly understood, they will affect the heart.\""

However, he is not rejoicing because of his past successes - he rejoices because the subject of his recollection is God. \"When I remember Thee ... and meditate on Thee in the night watches.\" The Jews divide the night into three watches of four hours each, and even though the night grows darker with each passing hour, and the shadows cast a more boding evil, David finds peace in God's unfailing faithfulness.\n\nDavid had a song in the night. CHS: \"Night is congenial, in its silence and darkness, to a soul which would forget the world [and whose thoughts dwell on heaven] ... We read of beds of ivory, but beds of piety are better far. Some revel in the night, but they are not a tithe so happy [a fraction as happy] as those who meditate in God.\"\n\nWhen we face difficulties, we sometimes forget God's past faithfulness. Thus \"I remember Thee\" is a good practical principle for Christians. From time to time, we need to stop along life's road and look back. The purpose is not to look back with regret at our past failures; neither is it to look back with self-gratification at our past successes. The purpose of looking back is to see the faithfulness of our travelling Partner. When we consider the past, we will realise that we do not walk alone, but that our Lord is with us at every bump on the road - every turn, every detour, and every incline. Our confidence is that our Lord has promised that He will never leave us nor forsake us, and He will continue to direct our every step."

David, who was not afraid of Goliath, was terrified by the adversary who lurked in the dark, and who planned and executed in secret.

The only Person that David could call upon for protection was the all-seeing and all-knowing God.\n\nCHS: \"When their secret counsels break forth into clamorous tumults, be Thou still my preserver. When they think evil, let Thy divine thoughts defeat them; and when they do evil, let Thy powerful justice overthrow them ... Let me be out of reach of their cruel hand, and even out of sight of their evil eye.\"\n\nThere is a second danger to this hidden enemy, namely his choice of weapon; it is neither the sword nor the arrow but his tongue and words. To kill with a sword, the attacker must come near to David. To kill with an arrow, the enemy must at least have David in his sight. Not so with hateful words spoken from a malicious tongue. Poisoned words can be hurled at a great distance and still damage a person's name. No doubt David was the subject of many a wicked rumour.\n\nThe only defense of the maligned saint is our Saviour.

Hence, his worship is not haphazard honour but prepared praise. His worship is focused; its theme specific. To worship God is in itself a blessing, but the man who knows the reasons for his worship enjoys a double measure of it.\n\nFor the Psalmist, his reason is that he is being drawn nigh to God. CHS: \"We are chosen of God, according to the good pleasure of His will, and this alone is blessedness ... Since we cannot and will not come to God of ourselves, He works graciously in us, and attracts us powerfully; He subdues our unwillingness, and removes our inability by the almighty workings of His transforming grace ...  [We] are made nigh by the blood of His Son, and brought ... into intimate fellowship ... to become dwellers in the divine household ... Behold what manner of love and blessedness the Father has bestowed upon us that we may dwell in His house.\"\n\nDavid describes God's choosing (election) as a blessing. Yet there are many people who regard election as a spite on man's free-will. They would rather believe that it is the sinner who has the final say in the matter of his eternal destiny. Many want to know about election of God before they come to the God Who elects. But no man by his own wisdom can reason out the mystery of God's election.

All the earth shall worship Thee, and shall sing unto Thee; they shall sing to Thy name\" (vv. 1-4).\n\nMusic in worship, thus, is a natural outflowing of the believers' joy. There is a difference between the world's music which expresses man's emotions and the spiritual songs which are focused on the Lord. The Psalmist invites the world not just to sing but to \"come and see the works of God: He is terrible [awesome] in His doing toward the children of men\" (v. 5). The awesomeness of God is most evident in His governance; and most fearsome to the stubborn rebels -  \"He ruleth by His power for ever ... let not the rebellious exalt themselves.\"\n\nCHS: \"His hand rules and His eye observes ...

        "verse": "God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause His face to shine upon us; That Thy way may be known upon earth, Thy saving health among all nations. (Psalm 67:1-2)",
        "text": "The sixty-seventh psalm begins with the Aaronic blessing (Num. 6:24-26). The Psalmist entreats the Lord to shine His face upon the righteous. When God turns His face away from people, it is an indication of His wrath. But when His shines His face, it speaks of His favour. And the chief blessing of God which we should yearn for is His tender mercy.\n\nCHS: \"Forgiveness of sin is always the first link in the chain of mercies experienced by us. Mercy is a foundation attribute in our salvation. The best saints and the worst sinners may unite in this petition. It is addressed to the God of mercy, by those who feel their need of mercy, and it implies the death of all legal hopes or claims of merit.\"\n\nGod's blessing makes life not only possible but also enjoyable. But His blessings are not meant to be privately enjoyed by His people. Rather, the blessings of God are tokens of His favour so that His \"way may be known upon the earth.\"\n\nNote that the Psalmist supposes that there is the way of God and the way that is not of God. Solomon tells us that the way which seems right to man \"the end thereof are the ways of death\" (Prov. 14:12). The way of God, on the other hand, leads to life and blessings. But God does not bestow His blessings arbitrarily; there are certain rules by which He acts. The point is that from observing God's blessing to His people, the unbelievers may know of God's sovereign grace and acknowledge Him as their God. The other lesson is that through the blessedness manifested in the Christian parent's life, our own household may be acquainted with the way in which God deals with His people."

        "text": "The sixthy-eighth psalm is a battle hymn. The words of this psalm have been adopted by many generals throughout history including Oliver Cromwell and Henry of Navarre. Henry was the Protestant leader of the French Huguenots. In 1589, they were surrounded by the armies of the Catholic League at the town of Dieppe. Fog had set in and prevented Henry from using his artillery against the enemies. On the brink of defeat, Henry rallied his troops with the singing of Psalm 68. The fog lifted and the Huguenots were able to break through the enemy forces.\n\nThis is the same battle hymn that Christians need to sing as we call upon God to fight for us. Arise, God, and drive away the enemies. CHS: \"Our glorious Captain of the vanguard clears the way readily ... He has but to arise, and they flee, He has easily over thrown His foes in days of lore (the past), and will do so all through the ages to come.\"\n\nBlessed is the man whose enemies are also God's enemies, then can we be sure of our victory. God is the mighty conqueror. He is also the Father to the fatherless, a judge to the widows - this is one of the most tender titles of God for there is nothing more helpless than the orphans and no one more despised than the destitute widows. But blessed also is the man who has God as his Father. The Almighty who is able to destroy powerful armies is also tender enough to reach down to the weak and despised. More powerful than the destruction of armies by His power is the manifestation of His love towards sinners. God condescended to take the place of the parent in one case, and to be the protector in the other."

        "text": "\"Let God arise\"; \"Let God take the lead.\" With God at the head of the procession, the effects were unmistakable - the earth trembled, the heavens shook, the wilderness moved, but God's people were never lost because He went before them; they were never in want because He provided for their needs. So it is for the Christian - with God at the centre of our lives, we can be sure that He has prepared His goodness for us.\n\nIn the light of God's mercy, the response from His people ought to be spontaneous. \"The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.\" In this context, the company refers to the chorus of women who raised their voices as their men came home victorious.\n\nCHS: \"The women ran from tent to tent and roused their lords to battle. Ready as they always were to chant the victory, they were equally swift to publish the fact that the battle-note had been sounded ... O for the like zeal in the church of today, that, when the gospel is published, both men and women may eagerly spread the glad tidings of great joy.\"\n\nThe idea here is not that only women published the Word of God, rather, as was the practice in ancient days, the men were cheered by the women as they went out to war, and they were greeted by the women upon their victorious return. But, as Spurgeon recognises, the verse has an importance beyond the original context. The church today is in desperate need not of pulpiteers, but of men and women, young and old who are willing to join the great company of those who publish the Word of God."

        "text": "The geography of Israel is littered with numerous mountain ranges. The highest mountain is Mount Hermon to the north, which stands over 9,000 feet. What about Mount Zion? It is certainly nothing when compared to the size and magnificence of Hermon, but Zion is \"the hill which God desireth to dwell in\" (v. 16). Yet this is the modus operandi of God. He is not impressed with greatness, neither is He impressed with numbers (vv. 17-18). Instead, the Lord chooses \"the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ... the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty ... things which are not, to bring to nought things that are\" (1 Cor. 1:27-28).\n\nIt is no shame to be a fool for Christ, a weak instrument in His mighty hand. CHS: \"A multitude of the sons of men are the willing captives of Messiah's power ... Jesus leads forth from the territory of His foe a vast company ... of converts as the trophies of His mighty grace. From the gracious character of His reign it comes to pass that to be ... [a captive of Christ is to be free from the captivity of our sin ... He puts death to death, entombs the grave, and leads captivity captive.\"\n\nHappy is the man who has the Lord as his yoke because it is easy and His burdens are light. Happy is the man who is held captive by God because the conqueror of our soul is also the God of our salvation. Thus wrote George Matheson of such a total and sweet surrender:\n\nMake me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free.\nForce me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be.\nI sink in life's alarms when by myself I stand;\nImprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand."

They have seen Thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. (Psalm 68:22-24)",
        "text": "The picture of God as the mighty conqueror is the Christian's hope; it is also the unrighteous' horror. The victory of Christ must necessarily mean the utter defeat of His enemies. David describes God's victory over the foes in horrific terms - He crushed their heads, and He dipped His feet in the blood of His enemies.\n\nCHS: \"Vengeance shall be awarded to the oppressed people, and that most complete and terrible ... So overwhelming should be the defeat of the foe that dogs should lick their blood ... Terrible is the God of Israel when He comes as a Man of war, and dreadful is the Christ of God when He bares His arm to smite His enemies.\"\n\nThe destruction of the enemies was further contrasted with the rejoicing of God's people (vv. 25-27). As a general principle, Christians must never rejoice over God's vengeance over His enemies because we, but for the grace of God, deserve the same.\n\nNo doubt, the language is explicit and strong, but the acts of the enemies were also vile. After all, they have hated the Lord of the universe and showed their contempt for Him by committing wickedness. Hence, it is important to see the rejoicing of the righteous in this context. The stake of the spiritual battle is nothing less than the hearts and minds of God's people. We cannot fully appreciate the need for the crushing defeat of sin until we recognize the pernicious nature of the evil one. Neither can we ever fully appreciate the Christ of Calvary unless we regard sin with absolute contempt."

        "verse": "Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submits himself with pieces of silver: scatter Thou the people that delight in war. (Psalm 68:30)",
        "text": "David prays for God to summon His strength and scatter the people that delight in war - a picture of a defeated army in disarray. CHS: \"God's people were peacemen, and only desired the crushing of oppressive nations, that war might not occur again. Let the battles of peace be as fierce as they will; heap coals of fire on the heads of enemies, and slay their enmity thereby ... Devoutly may we offer this prayer, and with equal devotion, we may bless God that it is sure to be answered, for 'He breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder, He burneth the chariot in the fire.'\"\n\nThe God Who scatters the unrepentant sinners is also the One Who causes the princes of Egypt and Ethiopia to stretch out their hands unto Him. The outstretched hand is an act of supplication and submission to God. This is also the gesture of lasting peace.\n\nLasting peace is not achieved by an occasional defeat of the enemies because the heart of man is constantly at war with God. Lasting peace can only be achieved when the enemies of God humble themselves to the Almighty, when the very weapons of war are replaced by the instruments of peace, when the heart that is at enmity with God embraces His love, and the sinner becomes His friend. Lasting peace - God's peace - is not attained by man's forced submission to the Almighty; rather, it is the drawing of the sinner by the grace of God for \"no man can come to Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw him\" (John 6:44a). So we echo with David asking God to summon His strength, soften the sinner's hardened heart, and draw us to Himself."

        "text": "The sixty-eighth psalm begins with a prologue, asking God to arise and lead His army into war. It ends with an epilogue with a praise to God for what He has done, \"Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord\" (v. 32).\n\nHowever, man's praise is but a chorus. The main aria is carried by God Himself. The eternal God Who rides the highest heavens sends out His voice. He will declare His own majesty. CHS: \"Was there a thunder-clap just then heard in heaven? Or, did the poet's mind flash backward to the time when from the heaven of heavens the voice of Jehovah broke the long silence and said, 'light be,' ['let there be light,'] and light was. To this hour, the voice of God is power. This gospel, which utters and reveals his word, is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. Our voices are fitly called to praise Him whose voice spoke us into being, and gives us the effectual grace which secures our well being.\"\n\nThe wicked may boast of their own strength, but the Christian would rather acknowledge the power of God. CHS: \"When even His voice rends the rocks and uproots the cedars, what cannot His hand do? ... Let us never by our doubts or our daring defiances appear to deny power unto God; on the contrary, by yielding to Him and trusting in Him, let our hearts acknowledge His might. When we are reconciled to God, His omnipotence is an attribute of which we sing with delight.\"\n\nIf this psalm were set to music, David's final words will crescendo to a crashing fortissimo - the God Who is holy; the God Who dwells in the heavens; the God Who keeps His covenant with Israel; and finally the God Who is blessed. Our only appropriate response is \"at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\" (Phil. 2:10-11)"

        "text": "The sixty-ninth psalm contains the essential elements of lament, imprecatory and Messianic psalms. It is a lament because David clearly was in despair over the persecution by his enemies. It is an imprecatory psalm because David called upon God to punish his oppressors (vv. 22-28). The psalm ends with more than God's deliverance but the promise of God's glorious redemption through the Messiah. This is one of the most quoted psalms in the New Testament, and it is all relating to the atoning work of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nThe attention in the opening verse is focused on David's sad situation. He was overwhelmed with problems that were not of his own doing and beyond his capabilities. David could not stand; he was sinking. CHS: \"Everything gave way under the sufferer; he could not get foothold for support ... The sorrow gathers even greater force ... [they] were first within, then around, and now above him.\"\n\nI remember the time when a group of us was crossing a river as part of a military training. My life-jacket had a leak, and in mid-stream, I felt myself sinking. I kicked with my legs, trying to keep my head above the water, but I was weighed down by all my equipment. There was no standing and I was only sinking. Adversities of life do the same to us. The harder we try, the worse it seems to get, to the point where we can only cry out, \"Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul\" (v. 1).\n\nThe only help must come from above. Praise the Lord that He is our Saviour. \"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee ... \" (Isa. 43:2). Look to Jesus for He is willing and able to save."

Let it not be said of you that here is the person who is a Christian in name only.\n\nHowever, there are also times when we are rejected because we take a stand for the truth. To be despised by our enemies is to be expected. To suffer the rejection of our loved ones - to be a stranger in your own home - is truly the bitter pill.\n\nCHS: \"What pangs must have smitten thy loving heart to be thus forsaken by those who should have loved thee, defended thee, and, if need be, died for thee ... As David's brethren envied him, and spake [spoke] evil of him, so our Lord's relatives by birth were jealous of Him, and His best beloved followers in the hour of His agony were afraid to be known as having any connection with Him ... May none of us ever act as if we were strangers to Him; never may we treat Him as if He were an alien to us: rather let us resolve to be crucified with Him, and may grace turn the resolve into fact.\"\n\nTo you who bear the name of Christ and who suffer for His sake, He whispers this promise, \"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven\" (Matt. 5:11-12a)."

Because \"there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved\" (Acts 4:12b). Only Jesus saves. Only Christ is able and willing to deliver. This is the blessed truth that calls us to prayers.\n\nDavid knew the power of prayer, so when he was sinking in the mire of life's adversities, he pleaded, \" ... hear me speedily\" (v. 17). Desperate times calls for more earnest and more urgent prayers.\n\nPrayer is calling upon God not because we are good but because He is. Prayer is putting ourselves into God's care not because we deserve it but because He is full of mercy. True prayer is drawing near to God, pleading for Him to turn His blessed face upon us, and not to hide Himself from us but to draw near to us. In times of trouble, David first prayed not much to be delivered from it, but more that God would draw nigh to his soul (v. 18).\n\nCHS: \"The near approach of God is all the sufferer needs; one smile of heaven will still the rage of hell ... It shall be redemption to me if Thou wilt appear to comfort me. This is a deeply spiritual prayer, and one very suitable for a deserted soul. It is in renewed communion that we shall find redemption realised.\""

David looked for someone who would come alongside to encourage him, but \"there was none\". He looked for comforters, but he found none. The loneliness makes the gall of reproach even more bitter, and his heart even more broken than it already was. This was certainly true of our blessed Saviour in the closing hours of His earthly ministry. When he found the three beloved disciples sleeping, our Lord asked, \"What, could ye not watch with me one hour?\" (Matt. 26:40).\n\nCHS: \"The heaviness of our Lord in the garden is expressed by many and forcible words in the four gospels, and each term goes to show that the agony was beyond measure great; He was filled with misery ...

His dearest ones had sought their own safety, and left their Lord alone.\"\n\nThe stories of Gethsemane and Calvary are the accounts of loneliness. Our Lord knew that He was to be deserted by friends. He was \"touched with the feeling of our infirmities\". He was in all points tempted like as we are. He knew that He was to be in need of comforters and yet could find none. He knew the bitterness of a broken heart and it is upon this assurance that we know we will not be lonely in times of betrayal; Our Lord knew the pain of desertion, and hence His promise - \"I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee\" (Heb. 13:5b)"

We know this to be true from our own life experience, and if that is what life is all about, it would be depressing indeed; but it is not.\n\nDavid had a broken heart (v. 20), but in Christ, he had a living one, and he was not afraid to make it known. CHS: \"Grateful hearts are ever on the look- out for recruits, and the rejoicing Psalmist discerns with joy the fact that other oppressed and lowly men observing the Lord's dealings with His servants are encouraged ... [in] their own tribulations. The standing consolation of the godly is the experience of their Lord ... His triumph has secured ours ...

The one who needs it musters all his strength and makes known his need not once but repeatedly. Like David, we must call upon God earnestly. Note the sense of urgency with which he begins and ends his prayer - \"Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord ... make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying\" (vv. 1, 5).\n\nLike David, we must come to God recognising our own weakness. For it is in our weakness that God is magnified. CHS: \"All true worshippers, though as yet in the humble ranks of seekers, shall have cause for joy. Even though the seeking commences in darkness, it shall bring light with it ... Those who have tasted divine grace, and are, therefore, wedded to it ... these shall not only feel joy, but shall with holy constancy and perseverance tell abroad their joy, and call upon men to glorify God.\"\n\nThere are two forms of magnification. We can magnify by using the microscope, which makes a small thing appear larger than it really is. Or we can magnify by using the telescope, which makes a distant thing appear nearer. It is the latter that aptly describes the Christian's desire to magnify God. The Almighty Creator is the \"high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, Whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones\" (Isa. 57:15). As I write, Charles Wesley's hymn - And Can It Be - was playing in the background. When the world sees the work of grace in our lives, there can only be one response - \"Amazing love! How can it be, that Thou, my God shouldst die for me?\" Not I, but Christ be magnified always!"

David had proved his faith by notable exploits when he was a youth and ruddy; it was to him a cheering recollection, and he felt persuaded that the God of his youth would not forsake him in his age.\"\n\n\"Thou art my trust from my youth\" also speaks to Christian parents, who have the responsibility to nurture their children's faith. Paul said of Timothy that from a child he has known the Holy Scriptures through the instruction of his grandmother and mother.\n\nNew to town, Little Johnny was invited to Sunday School by the Preacher. \"What do they teach in that Sunday School?\" asked Johnny.

We are called to persevere in fighting the good fight and keeping the faith. A man might have been faithful to God from his youth up, but there are no free passes in his old age. His zeal for God at the dawn of his life is not a license for indulgence in his evening years. Faith is the race that ends when we go into the welcoming arms of our Saviour, and hear Him say, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\"\n\nDavid was worried that when he was aged, when his faculties failed, his strength sapped and his enthusiasm ebbed, and when he could no longer be as active in serving the Lord, he would be cast off.\n\nCHS: \"Old age robs us of personal beauty, and deprives us of strength for active service; but it does not lower us in the love and favour of God. An ungrateful country leaves its worn-out defenders to starve upon a scanty pittance, but the pensioners of heaven are satisfied with good things ... To be forsaken of God is the worst of all conceivable ills ...

David would give his best music [to the Saviour] ... It shall be no weariness to me [us] to praise Thee. It shall be a delightful recreation, a solace, a joy ... Till men are redeemed, they are like instruments out of tune; but when once the precious blood has set them at liberty, then are they fitted to magnify the Lord Who bought them. Our being bought with a price is a more than sufficient reason for our dedicating ourselves to the earnest worship of God our Saviour ... [our] theme shall be Thy way of justifying sinners, the glorious display of Thy righteousness and grace in Thy dear Son ... Others talk of their beloved, and they shall be made to hear of mine [ours].\"\n\nThe theme of the seventy-first psalm is God's faithfulness. God is faithful (1 Cor. 1:9), and this is the hymn that we must sing with our lips and our lives.\n\nGreat is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father\nThere is no shadow of turning with Thee\nThou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not;\nAs Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be ... \nGreat is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me."

Charles Hodge says that \"the subject of the psalm must be a divine person. His kingdom is to be everlasting, universal, secures perfect peace with God and goodwill among men.\" Who but Christ can fulfill such a grand mission?\n\nThe first character of His divine kingdom is righteousness (vv. 1-4), and where there is true righteousness, peace prevails. CHS: \"Where truth and uprightness are on the throne, the best of men prosper most ... He [Jesus] is known as the true Melchizedek, king both of righteousness and peace. Peace based upon right is sure to be lasting, but no other will be. Many a so-called holy alliance ... [failed because] craftiness formed the league, perjury established it, and oppression was the design of it; but He will ordain perpetual peace, and men shall learn war no more. The peace which Jesus brings is not superficial or shortlived; it is abundant in its depth and duration.\"\n\nDear reader, men have laboured for peace, but men's engineered peace is both fleeting and fragile. The peace of our Lord, on the other hand, flourishes in our hearts in all other circumstances. As our Lord said, \"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you\" (John 14:27a). Our Lord is not merely the provider of peace, but He is peace Himself. To you who have found the righteousness of God through His Son, we have the peace with God (Rom. 5:1) as well as the peace of God (Phil. 4:7) because He is the Prince of Peace."

Plato formulated his ideas in Republic; Thomas More in Utopia. Politicians tried it; Franklin Roosevelt named his plan the New Deal, Lyndon Johnson called his the Great Society. Individuals such as Robert Owen also attempted such social experiments. In 1825, the wealthy Scotsman bought a town in Indiana and named it New Harmony with the promise of starting a utopian society. It lasted two short years before his ideal society disintegrated.\n\nThere is only one society that promises enduring peace and compassion.

His name shall be blessed; His name is glorious, and that glory shall fill the whole earth. For so bright a consummation our heart yearns daily, and we cry 'Amen, and Amen.'\"\n\nChristians, see the order of God's kingdom.

        "text": "The seventy-third psalm marks the beginning of the third book (Psalms 73-83) of the Psalter. It was composed by Asaph, a member of the tribe of Levi who had been appointed by David to be responsible for worship music (1 Chron. 6:39).\n\nIn this psalm, Asaph asked one of life's most perplexing questions - why do the righteous suffer? Asaph looked at the world and what he saw bothered him. He saw the prosperity of the wicked and the poverty of the righteous. He saw the strength of the evil doer and the weakness of God's people.\n\nLife can be, and is, very difficult for the godly. In Asaph's mind - and ours -  the wicked should get their just deserts and only the godly should prosper. One word describes Asaph's attitude - envy.\n\nCHS: \"His eye was fixed too much on one thing; he saw their present, and forgot their future, saw their outward display, and overlooked their soul's discomfort. Who envies the bullock his fat when he recollects the shambles? Yet some poor afflicted saint has been sorely tempted to grudge the ungodly sinner his temporary plenty.\"\n\nWhat Asaph saw did not square up with what he knew to be true (v. 1), and his envy nearly caused him to backslide (v. 2). Wrapped with self-pity and filled with resentment, Asaph questioned God, and he nearly became one of those whom he envied. It was only the goodness of God that kept him from slipping into unbelief. This is sustaining grace!\n\nFaith in God's goodness is a challenge; that is why many have departed from it to put their trust in uncertain riches. Yet faith yields its best reward because without faith, it is impossible to please God; and we who come to \"God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him\" (Heb. 11:6). Better to pray that God help us with our unbelief than reject Him totally."

There are many things in life for which we have no answers, but few rouse such frustration as that which we perceive to be unjust. Asaph was angry with God because he thought that God was not treating the godly the way he thought they should be treated. Instead, the wicked were rich, healthy and arrogant.\n\nCHS: \"They flatter themselves that their oppressions and persecutions are unobserved of heaven ... Boasting of their own knowledge, they yet dare to ask ... 'If there be a God, is He not too much occupied with other matters to know what is going on upon this world?' ... [Such] is the insanity of the graceless theists of this age; theists in name ... but atheists in practice ... \"\n\nDoes God know about the sacrilege of the wicked? And does He care about the sufferings of the righteous? Our Lord knows and He cares, but He does not always reveal. A young man was on vacation with his friends. Within a short time, he had spent all the money that his father had given him. He wrote to his father for some more, but his father decided to teach his son the lesson of faithful stewardship so he decided not to respond. The young man's friends offered reasons for his father's silence, but he told them, \"I know my father loves me. He has a reason. I will know when I get home. He will tell me himself.\"\n\nThis is the attitude that the believer must have towards our Heavenly Father. Life holds many unanswered questions. We do not know a lot of things for His ways are higher than our ways (Isa. 55:9). There is, however, one thing that we know - \"Truly God is good ... to such as are of a clean heart\" (v. 1)."

Every believer would have walked through these dark alleys of doubt and depression.\n\nShould we vocalise our spiritual discontent? Ought we murmur against God? Asaph gives this wise advice, \"If I say ... I should offend against the generation of thy children.\" Asaph was conscious of his words lest they offend others. Man's weakness is that we tend to speak too soon and too much, and our words become a snare for the young and impressionable. This sensitivity to others is a virtue that God's people must cultivate. As Christians, we must be mindful of our words. We must be careful that we do not say or do anything that would weaken another person's confidence in God.\n\nWhen we do not know what to say, the best thing to do is to pray and to go into the sanctuary of God. CHS: \"His mind entered the eternity where God dwells as in a holy place, he left the things of sense for the things invisible, his heart gazed within the veil, he stood where the thrice holy God stands. Thus he shifted his point of view, and apparent disorder resolved itself into harmony.\"\n\n\"Until I went into the sanctuary of God ... \" - God has an open invitation for us to His throne of grace. However, we will remain spiritually destitute until we come to that fountain where His mercy flows. It is in the sanctuary of God that we will understand it all. It is when we draw near to God that we see life - its up's and down's - as He has determined it. And our only conclusion then will be that He is good."

The Psalmist begins with two questions that strike at the very heart of Who God is. \"Has God cast away His people forever?\" \"Will the Shepherd destroy the sheep of His fold?\" In other words, is it possible that God is unfaithful and unforgiving? Is He unloving and uncaring?\n\nThe wailing tone of this lament rises with the magnitude of God's anger. Grief and despair can sometimes give way to impiety and doubt. When the fire of God's wrath gets too intense, the recourse is not in self-righteous justification, but a humble pleading of His mercy, \"Remember Thy congregation.\"\n\nCHS: \"Let us put Him in remembrance ... Can He desert His blood-bought and forsake His redeemed? Can election fail and eternal love cease to flow? Impossible. The woes of Calvary, and the covenant of which they are the seal, are the security of the saints ... His church is His kingdom, over which He stretches the rod of sovereignty; will He allow His possessions to be torn from Him? God's property in us is a fact full of comfort: His value of us, His dominion over us, His connection with us are all so many lights to cheer our darkness. No man will willingly lose his inheritance, and no prince will relinquish his dominions; therefore we believe that the King of kings will hold His own, and maintain His rights against all comers.\"\n\nWhat should we ask the Lord to remember? Certainly not our sins or our tainted works of \"righteousness\". Our best plea is that we belong to Him. Our Lord has purchased us. We are His inheritance. The logic is unassailable. Surely God Who has redeemed us with the life of His beloved Son would never nullify His work by casting us off forever. Christ is our hope of eternal security."

Sin emboldens the enemies' attacks upon God's people. Worst of all, God appeared to be silent at the time when the people needed Him most.\n\nCHS: \"No Urim and Thummim blazed on the High Priest's bosom, and no Shekinah shone from between the cherubim ...

It is a terrible thing to be without God's Word. Sadly today many people, including Christians, put themselves under this judgement. It is not that we cannot have access to the Holy Scriptures; neither is there a lack of opportunities or resources to study the Word of God.

In 1588, it was sung in English churches to celebrate the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

Although Judah and Israel were unhappily divided politically, yet the godly of both nations were agreed concerning Jehovah their God; and truly whatever schisms may mar the visible church, the saints always 'appear as one' in magnifying the Lord their God.\"\n\nGod is known in Judah. It is true that the whole creation bears the fingerprint of God (Rom. 1:20); however, it is in Judah that He is worshipped. This statement focuses on the exclusiveness of the Gospel. Only in Judah can God be known. Only in Christ is God revealed. Our Lord Jesus told Philip, \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father\" (John 14:9. See also 1 John 5:20).

Man suffers from all sorts of fears - agoraphobia (fear of open spaces), claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces), arachnophobia (fear of spiders), etc. These phobias have debilitating effects on their sufferers. However, there is one fear that all man must have - the fear of God. \"Thou, even Thou, art to be feared\" (v. 7a).\n\nGod alone is to be feared because He alone judges righteously and will give to every sinner what he truly deserves. Before His holy presence, every sinner will stand in silent contrition. God's fear is also His salvation.

        "text": "\"How good life was back then\" - this was the complaint of the Psalmist. He remembered how the Lord answered his prayers. When he cried, God gave ear unto him (v. 1). When the Psalmist looked back at the past, he remembered God's mercies. But things have changed. God seems to have abandoned him.\n\nBitterness in the taste buds is enhanced after you have tasted sweetness. So it is spiritually, the bitterness of the soul is deepened by the withdrawing of the sweetness of heavenly mercies. The Psalmist remembered the song in the night  -  the song he sang in times of affliction. The misery never silenced the music. No matter how dark the situation, the Psalmist could always find something which he could praise God for. But how much have things changed! The Psalmist recalled those times when the Lord sustained and comforted him. The music might not have stopped, but the tune had changed.\n\nCHS: \"He Who is the wellspring of delight to faith became an object of dread to the Psalmist's distracted heart. The justice, holiness, power, and truth of God have all a dark side ... even the brightness of divine love blinds us, and fills us with a horrible suspicion that we have neither part nor lot in it. He is wretched indeed whose memories of the Ever Blessed prove distressing to him; yet the best of men know the depth of this abyss.\"\n\nHas God stopped His mercies? Has God changed? No, the Lord is the same yesterday, today and forever. The Psalmist's complaints prove this point. He says, \"I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.\" He looks to restore God's presence in his life. He endeavours to bring those things back into his life again. God's grace is ever sufficient, and the afflictions of life should drive us to, rather than away from, God. We who have tasted God's sweetness should never give in to life's bitterness."

        "text": "It seems that Asaph's depression has given way to doubt, and his sorrow has fuelled his skepticism. He asks a series of six questions. Some look at these questions as hammer blows breaking one's faith, but I think the real intent is to secure God's love firmly in our heart.\n\nThere is only one answer to all six questions - No! Will the Lord reject us forever? No (Heb. 13:5). Will He never be favourable again? No (Ps. 149:4). Has His lovingkindness ceased forever? No (Jer. 31:3). Has His promise come to an end forever? No (Num. 23:19). Has the God of grace forgotten to be gracious? No (Ps. 25:6). Has His mercies dried up? No (Lam. 3:22-23).\n\nLike Asaph, we know the answers to all six questions. They clarify our minds; they put things in the right perspective; and they turn our hearts to God. CHS: \"Fly back, my soul, away from present turmoils, to the grandeurs of history, the sublime deeds of Jehovah, the Lord of Hosts; for He is the same and is ready even now to defend His servants as in days of yore ... [Thankful] memory is a fit handmaid for faith ... [Holy meditation] has a consoling power.\"\n\nBut why would a loving God put us through the trials of fire? A young Christian man had put all his money into an orchard. But a week-long frost destroyed his crop. He did not go to church that Sunday, or the next, or the one after. The pastor visited the man to find out what was wrong. The young man explained: \"I'm not coming to church. Do you think I can worship a God Who cares for me so little that He will let a frost kill my crops?\"\n\nThe pastor answered, \"God loves you more than He does your peaches. You care about the peaches. God cares about you. His object is to grow men, not peaches.\" Christian, take heart! Nothing \"shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord\" (Rom. 8: 39)."

        "text": "As Asaph remembers the past mercies of God, he also refreshes his knowledge of the Almighty. Asaph remembers the works of God and His wonders of old, and he sees with renewed faith, the holiness of the Lord.\n\nCHS: \"In the holy place we understand our God, and rest assured that all His ways are just and right. When we cannot trace His way, because it is 'in the sea,' it is a rich consolation that we can trust it, for it is in holiness. We must have fellowship with holiness if we would understand 'the ways of God to man.' He who would be wise must worship. The pure in heart shall see God, and pure worship is the way to the philosophy of providence.\"\n\nThe \"sanctuary\" in verse 13 is the \"holy place.\" It can also refer to God's holiness. Martin Luther translates the verse as \"O God, Thy way is holy.\" In both renditions, the idea is that God is holy in all His works; and we can only know of His divine providence when we come to the throne of grace in humble worship.\n\nGod is holy. God is also great - \"Who is so great a God as our God?\" He is the God \"that doest wonders.\" The forces of nature tremble in His presence (v. 16). His power is seen in the clouds and rain; in the thunder and lightnings (vv. 17-18). God is supreme over all.\n\nGod is also caring. He rules; He also redeems. He unleashes His terrifying power upon the world, but He also leads us tenderly as a Shepherd. Consider the Israelites' journey through the wilderness: they suffered thirst and hunger; they were harassed by enemies; they were bitten by poisonous serpents. But God led them to the Promised Land. Like Asaph, no matter how incomprehensible, we have to be encouraged by God's past doings, and trust that He Who \"hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ\" (Phil. 1:6)."

Teach him what you will, if he learns not the fear of the Lord, he will perish for lack of knowledge. Grammar is poor food for the soul if it be not flavoured with grace. Every school bag should have a Bible in it. The world may teach secular knowledge alone, that is all it can offer, but as God's people, we must not deal so with our children; we should look well to every Timothy, and see to it that from a child he knows the Holy Scriptures. Around the fireside Christian fathers should repeat not only the Bible records, but the deeds of the martyrs and reformers, and moreover the dealings of the Lord with themselves both in providence and grace. We would gladly see this oral tradition practised by every Christian in his family, and children taught cheerfully by word of mouth by their own mothers and fathers, as well as by the printed pages of what they too often regard as dull, dry task books. What happy hours and pleasant evenings have children had at their parents' knees as they have listened to some 'sweet story of old.' Reader, if you have children, mind that you do not fail in this duty.\"\n\nLearn and teach; thus is the golden chain of Christian heritage continued. \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places\" (Eph. 6:12). Every generation must fight its own spiritual battles, and parents will do well to prepare and equip our children so that they may learn to serve and glorify the Lord as we did."

How often have we also, though supplied with every gracious weapon, failed to wage successful war against our sins, we have marched onward gallantly enough till the testing hour has come, and then 'in the day of battle' we have proved false to good resolutions and holy obligations. Vows and promises were broken, idols were set up, and the living God was forsaken ...  [We fall to sin, and fail to] maintain a pure testimony for the one only true God.\" We give way to idolatry; we violate His laws; we become covenant breakers.\n\nAt the Battle of Bull Run in the American Civil War, a young solider was brought to the hospital with a gunshot wound. The father, on seeing his dying son, said, \"My poor boy, you are terribly hurt, I see, in the back.\"\n\n\"No, father, I am wounded in the breast. The bullet went in here,\" and he laid his hand on his breast, \"not at the back.\" The young soldier did not turn back in the day of battle; neither should God's people. We are to front the enemy, and resist the devil (James 4:7). Christian, \"Fight the good fight of faith\" to which you are called, and \"hast professed a good profession before many witnesses\" (1 Tim. 6:12). Never turn back on God in the day of battle."

Their concern is not what was done for them a few hours earlier, but what is being done for them now - what you are doing for me today. To the unthankful person, the past and the future are meaningless, and the present is to be exploited. Ingratitude is also a sign of spiritual immaturity.\n\nThe children of Israel forgot the marvellous works that God had done for their fathers. They cared nothing about the covenant promises that they had made with God. Their chief concern was what they could consume at the present time. They were willing to forget the past and forfeit the future so that they could have \"meat for their lust\".\n\nCHS: It is \"the nature of the disease of sin to proceed from bad to worse; men never weary of sinning, but rather increase their speed in the race of iniquity. In the case before us the goodness of God was abused into a reason for greater sin. Had not the Lord been so good they would not have been so bad. If He had wrought fewer miracles before, they would not have been so inexcusable in their unbelief, so wanton in their idolatry ... [God] was all bounty of love, and they all superfluity of naughtiness ... For them the heavens dropped manna, and they returned murmurs; the rocks gave them rivers, and they replied with floods of wickedness. Herein, as in a mirror, we see ourselves. Israel in the wilderness acted out, as in a drama, all the story of man's conduct towards his God.\"\n\nDear reader, beware of the sin of covetousness. The lust for meat turned the Israelites away from God, and they were judged because they believed not in Him, nor trusted in His salvation. How tragic it would be for a person to covet the meat that lasts for a season and forgo the eternal Bread of life."

What they ate on earth they digested in hell ... My soul, see here the danger of gratified passions; they are the janitors of hell. We must never dare to judge men's happiness by their tables, the heart is the place to look at. The poorest starveling believer is more to be envied than the most full-fleshed of the favourites of the world. Better be God's dog than the devil's darling.\"\n\nThe wrath of God came upon them while their meat was yet in their mouths. Moses wrote that the meat was between their teeth when God smote them with a very great plague (Num. 11:33). The people were unrestrained in their indulgence. The evidence of their sin was clearly evident to all except the gluttons themselves. The deception of sin is that it satisfies. It is like a man digging for gold. The deeper he digs, the more gold he finds, but he soon finds out that he cannot climb out of the hole that he has dug. That is the danger of sin - we are blinded by our own lust until we are oblivious of sin's deadly consequences."

They were fickle as a weathercock, every wind turned them, their mind was not settled upon God ... Their promises were no sooner made than broken, as if only made in mockery. Good resolutions called at their hearts as men do at inns; they tarried awhile, and then took their leave. They were hot today for holiness, but cold towards it tomorrow ... They changed from reverence to rebellion, from thankfulness to murmuring. One day they gave their gold to build a tabernacle for Jehovah, and the next they plucked off their earrings to make a golden calf.

They might have worshipped God outwardly, but their hearts were divided. They worshipped God, but they still retained a remnant of sin in their hearts.\n\nThe divided heart of man is contrasted with God's faithfulness. Although He knew their hearts, He was true to His character; He forgave their iniquities and remembered that they were but flesh (vv. 38-39). We are liars; God is not.

He was not chosen because he was a servant, but in order that he might be so. David always esteemed it to be a high honour that he was both elect of God, and a servant of God ... A shepherd of sheep he had been, and this was a fit school for a shepherd of men.

No matter how fierce the foe, or dire the captivity, the shining face of God ensures both victory and liberty.\"\n\nThe Psalmist's plea is honest and reasonable. He did not pray that God would turn them from their captivity; neither did he pray that God would turn to them. Israel rightly deserved God's judgement, and they were undeserving of His mercy. Instead, he prayed, \"Turn us.\"\n\nSin is our turning against and away from God. Repentance is our turning to Him. All will be right when we are right with God.

Israel became settled and established as a vine well rooted, and then it began to flourish and to spread on every side.\" Israel prospered and its power and influence were felt throughout the world.\n\nThis is also a picture of the believer and the church. The strength of a Christian and the church is determined by their foundation. As we grow deep in the faith, and strengthen our foundation, we are able to climb higher and spread farther.\n\nHow sad then were the words of Isaiah - \"[God] fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and He looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes\" (Isa. 5:2).\n\nThere have been in times past when the church of God commanded respect and honour because she stood for God, and her influence extended far and wide. How sad when we consider the state of the church today!

However, God allowed the vineyard to be overrun by wild beasts. The Psalmist could not understand how God would allow the vineyard planted by His own hand to be burned with fire. Yet there was hope in the ruined heaps.\n\nThe Psalmist looked forward to the man of God's right hand. Undoubtedly, Asaph was speaking of the Messiah, the One whom God has ordained to be the Saviour.\n\nCHS: \"Let thy power rest on Thy true Benjamin, son of thy right hand. Honour Him, save us, and glorify thyself ... Send forth Thy power with Him whom Thou shalt strengthen to accomplish Thy purposes of grace. It pleases God to work for the sons of men by sons of men. 'By man came death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead.' It is by the man Christ Jesus that fallen Israel is yet to rise, and indeed through Him, who deigns to call Himself the Son of Man, the world is to be delivered from the dominion of Satan and the curse of sin. O Lord, fulfill Thy promise to the man of Thy right hand, who participates in Thy glory, and give Him to see the pleasure of the Lord prospering in His Hand.\"\n\nThe Son of Man sets the seal upon a new commitment. \"So will not we go back from Thee\" (v. 18a). As the words of the children's chorus remind us -\n\nI have decided to follow Jesus\nNo turning back, no turning back!\nThe world behind me, the cross before me,\nNo turning back, no turning back!\n\nDear reader, this is the only way to follow Jesus."

The very first act of salvation was to deliver the children of Israel from their bondage in Egypt.\n\nCHS: \"Israel was the drudge and slave of Egypt, but God gave him liberty. It was by God alone that the nation was set free ... He was no longer compelled to carry earth, and mould it, and bake it; the earth-basket was no more imposed upon the people, nor the tale of bricks exacted, for they came out into the open country where none could exact upon them.\"\n\nThe history of man's freedom is always preceded by war. Other people owe their liberties to their own efforts and courage, but Israel received liberty as a free gift of divine power. The same things can also be said of the Christian; we are free from the bondage of sin, free from the burden of religious rituals and works of righteousness because our Lord Jesus has set us free. \"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed\" (John 8:36).\n\nCHS: \"The story of Israel is only our own history in another shape. God has heard us, delivered us, liberated us, and too often our unbelief makes the wretched return of mistrust, murmuring, and rebellion. Great is our sin; great is the mercy of our God: let us reflect upon both, and pause a while.\""

God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them\" (Exod. 2:23-25).\n\nThe history of Israel is a record of God's favours. Right in the heart of this psalm is a reminder of who God is and what He has done - \"I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt\" (v. 10a). This is the preamble to the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20:2). The history of Israel is also a record of the people's forgetfulness - \"My people would not hearken to My voice; and Israel would none of Me.\"\n\nCHS: God's \"warnings were rejected, His promises forgotten, His precepts disregarded. Though the divine voice proposed nothing but good to them ...  yet they turned aside ... They would not consent to His proposals, they walked in direct opposition to His commands ... and their hearts were bewitched by the idols of the nations round about.\"\n\nThe same spiritual disease afflicts our hearts, and it is only because of God's grace that we have not totally turned our faces away from our Saviour. The real issue is not whether or not we believe in and worship God. The real spiritual battle is not between believers and atheists; the real battle is fought in the heart of every Christian - it is whether or not we love and obey Him.\n\n\"I am the LORD thy God\" is a demand for undivided allegiance. The alternative is God's giving us up to our own lusts - a prospect too dreadful to contemplate. There is no punishment more severe than this. When God gives us up, there is no possibility for salvation. If we walk according to our own counsels, there is only one way and one sure destination. But when God chastens, He does so out of love (Heb. 12:5-6), and there is still hope yet."

        "text": "\"Ye are gods ... ye are children of the most High.\" The \"gods\" simply means that some people were given the honour and the authority by God to rule over men. The \"gods\" [elohim] are human judges [elohim] (Exod. 21:6; John 10:34-36). No doubt the judges are several rungs above the common man, but they are men nonetheless.\n\nCHS: \"They were delegated gods ... This was their ex-officio character [office], not their moral or spiritual relationship ... Magistrates would have no right to condemn the guilty if God had not sanctioned the establishment of government, the administration of law, and the execution of sentences. Here the Spirit speaks most honourably of these offices, even when it censures the officers ... What sarcasm it seems! Great as the office made the men, they were still but men, and must die ... How quickly death unrobes the great. What a leveller he is. Great men die as common men do. No places are too high for death's arrows: he brings down his birds from the tallest trees. It is time that all men considered this.\"\n\nThe title confers a right and carries a responsibility. Asaph was lamenting about the evil that was perpetrated by the judges. Instead of preserving justice, they perverted it.tin Luther was preparing his notes on Psalm 82 when the Peasants' Revolt erupted in 1525, a perverse political version of the Reformation. The revolt tried to overthrow the established political classes. The peasants expected Luther's support, but he refused because he knew that spiritual goals ought not to be confused with political ones. Luther correctly pointed out that Psalm 82 both established and curtailed the authority. He wrote, \"For where there is no government, there can be no peace. Where there is no peace, no one can keep his life or anything else in the face of another's outrage. Much less will there be room to teach God's Word.\" Luther further suggested that this psalm should be memorised by everyone who is in a position of authority, including parents."

        "text": "This is the last of Asaph's psalms, which mostly calls on God to judge the enemies of Israel. In this national lament, Asaph prays for the Lord's intervention against her many enemies. There were ten in all (vv. 6-8). There was never an instance in Israel's history when ten enemies were arrayed against them, so it is more likely that the nations represent the enemies of God's people.\n\nNot only were the lives of the people in peril, the Name of God was at stake. Hence, Asaph called on God to arise and defeat the enemies. CHS: \"Here the appeal is to El, the Mighty One. He is entreated to act and speak, because His nation suffers and is in great jeopardy. Now entirely the Psalmist looks to God; he asks not for \"a leader bold and brave,\" or for any form of human force, but casts his burden upon the Lord, being well assured that his eternal power and Godhead could meet every difficulty of the case.\"\n\nThe Psalmist looks to no one but God alone. Only God can deliver. The enemies continue to plot against God's people. In the annals of history of the Jewish nation, there were many occasions when the Jews were threatened with extermination, and God seems to have been silent. They were enslaved; they were exiled by the Assyrians and Babylonians; they were expelled from Rome; they were persecuted in the Middle Ages; they were subjected to humiliating pogroms in eastern Europe, six million Jews were killed in the holocaust by the Nazis; yet the Jews prospered. A world census taken in 1836 showed that there were 3 million Jews. A century later, there were 16 million Jews despite wide anti-Semitic persecution in many countries. There can only be one reason why the Jews continue to thrive. God has not been silent. He keeps the promises that He had made to Abraham (Gen. 12:2-3).\n\nGod is never silent when we call upon Him. This is the petition that we should offer in times of crisis, when our honour and life are at stake. In times when He seems to be indifferent to our needs and dangers, call upon Him and we will see that He is with us all along."

        "text": "The Psalmist prays to God to destroy the enemies. He cites several historical precedents of God destroying the enemies of Israel (vv. 9-12). Now he is appealing to God to do the same: to scatter the enemies, destroy them, and bring them to an end.\n\nThis is an imprecatory prayer, one that calls for revenge. This seems to go against the tenor of the Christian faith which calls on us to be forgiving even to our enemies. To understand the reason for the Psalmist's prayer, we must understand the history of Israel's sufferings under the cruelties of her enemies. We would sympathise with Asaph even more when we see that he was not praying for his own deliverance but for God's honour and truth.\n\nThe Psalmist refers to Israel's enemies as God's enemies (v. 2) and to Israel as God's people. (v. 3) The enemies' plots are directed against God (v. 5) and when the enemies seized Israel, they are seizing God's land. (v. 12) In other words, the cause of God is at stake, and it is His battle. This perspective changes the way we think of Asaph's prayers. When we regard evil as directed at us personally and when we take action on our own accord, the response is revenge. However, when the evil is directed at God, we must leave it to Him to carry out His justice in His time and manner. We know that God will act. He is not indifferent. \"Avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the LORD\" (Rom. 12:19).\n\nThe purpose of Asaph's prayer is for God's name to be made known. CHS: \"Hearing of the Lord's marvellous deeds in defeating such a numerous confederacy, the very heathens would be compelled to acknowledge the greatness of Jehovah ... The godless race of man disregards this, and yet at times the wonderful works of the Lord compel the most unwilling to adore His majesty.\"\n\nJudgement may proclaim the Lord's power, but we must not forget that grace is manifested in His longsuffering love. God loves and He will judge -  He will do what is right. The day of judgement will come, but now is the day of grace because He \"is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance\" (2 Peter 3:9b)."

        "text": "Spurgeon describes the eighty-fourth psalm as \"one of the most sweet Psalms of Peace.\" It describes the Psalmist's desire to be found in God's house, and his delight as he comes to the blessed sanctuary, even if it is only for a day, even if he has to come as a doorkeeper.\n\nCHS: \"Under the most favourable circumstances in which earth's pleasures can be enjoyed, they are not comparable by so much as one in a thousand to the delights of the service of God ... Even a glimpse at the love of God is better than ages spent in the pleasures of sense ... The lowest station in connection with the Lord's house is better than the highest position among the godless. To bear burdens and open doors for the Lord is more honour than to reign among the wicked. God's worst is better than the devil's best. God's doorstep is a happier rest than downy couches within the pavilions of royal sinners.\"\n\nThe Psalmist compares himself to the sparrow and swallow who found refuge in God's sanctuary. And if God provides these birds with a home near His altar, how much more will He also provide a refuge for His people.\n\nSuch is the blessing of Christians. Besides the blessing of being able to dwell in God's house (v. 4), we have two other blessings - the blessing of God's strength and that of His guidance (v. 5). The Christian life is a pilgrimage through ups and downs, but no matter how rough the road, as long as we put our trust in God, we will go from strength to strength until Zion appears (v. 7). The second blessing comes with trusting in God (v. 12). There is a maturing in the Psalmist's spirituality as he trusts in the Lord. He looks beyond the house of God to God Himself. He starts off pining to be present in God's house and ends off pining to be in God's presence. That should be our spiritual goal as well. As we grow in faith, we will learn to see God as He is."

I am sure there have been times when you look back at the past and you ask, \"Where is the joy I knew when I first came to the Lord?\" You are discouraged. The pure joy of knowing that you are a child of the God of love seems to have vanished.\n\nThere are two reasons for this discouragement. First, we tend to look at the wrong things. We look at what we do not have, and forget about what God has provided. Second, the goodness of God has become so commonplace that we forget we are covered by His ubiquitous grace.\n\nThe Psalmist feels the same. He thanks God that He has turned from His anger (v. 3), yet he pleads for God's anger to cease. It seems that he too has forgotten God's goodness, and he needs - as we all do - a personal spiritual revival.\n\nCHS: \"We are dead or dying, faint and feeble, God alone can revive us, He has in other times refreshed His people, He is still the same, He will repeat His love ... Thou lovest to see Thy children happy with that best of happiness which centres in Thyself, therefore revive us, for revival will bring us the utmost joy ...  Those who were revived would rejoice not only in the new life but in the Lord Who was the author of it. Joy in the Lord is the ripest fruit of grace ...

It is never foolish to wait on God for He knows best what to do and when to do it. This makes the Christian's wait both hopeful and fruitful.\n\nThe Psalmist prayed and he waited, and he was not disappointed. He remembered that God had promised peace (v. 8); that He will save (v. 9); and that there will be a blessed company of mercy, truth, righteousness and peace (v. 10-11).\n\nCHS: \"In answer to prayer, the exulting Psalmist sees the attributes of God [uniting to bless.] ... Mercy comes hand-in-hand with Truth to fulfill the faithful promise of their gracious God; the people recognise at once the grace and the veracity of Jehovah ...

In Him and on the cross, the four attributes of mercy, truth, righteousness and peace are united for the purpose of our salvation. God's demand for righteousness is met with His mercy. The truthfulness of God with regard to His justice and love are also met on the cross. And the outcome is reconciliation and peace between the sinner and God.\n\nAs we live in obedience to God, we will continue to enjoy His blessings and will also be a blessing to others. The four attributes are communicable ones, meaning to say as God's people, we can and must display the grace of mercy, truth, righteousness and peace in our dealings with men as well."

Before God, David had never asserted his right as God's anointed king; instead, he said that he was a poor and needy servant (vv. 1-2). David pleaded for mercy, and he did so daily. To pray for mercy is to tug at the heart-strings of God. Call unto God, and He will answer you; for one that calls upon God will not be ashamed.\n\nCHS: \"The best of men need mercy, and appeal to mercy ... they need it for themselves, and crave it eagerly of their God as a personal requisite ... May we not, then, plead our importunity as an argument with God? He who prays every day, and all the day ... may rest assured that the LORD will hear him in the day of his need.\"\n\nDavid gave several reasons for God to answer his prayer for mercy. He was poor and needy (v. 1). He trusted in God (v. 2). He called upon God daily (v. 3). Persevering prayer alone is not enough for God to answer, but it is an indication of our faith in the Almighty. David called upon God alone (v. 4).\n\nGod must also answer David's prayer because God is good (v. 5). God is faithful; He has promised to answer our prayers (v. 7). God is great and does wondrous things (v. 10). God is loving and merciful (vv. 13-15). God has been faithful in times past and will continue to be faithful in years to come (v. 17).\n\nIn the same way, we must be sure of the reasons for our conviction that God would answer our prayers.

God prepared Canaan for Israel, but He has prepared a greater city (Heb. 11:10) - an eternal one - for those who have been redeemed by the precious blood of His Son. Why me for Zion? Nothing good to boast of my own, but only the love of God.\n\nBlessed Zion, the City of God, has been used as the theme for many poems and hymns. Augustine chose this phrase to be the title of his book. The City of God presents two cities established by two loves: an earthly city by the love of self, and a heavenly city by the love of God.

Job reminds us that \"man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble\" (Job 14:1).\n\nCHS: \"Like a vessel full to the brim with vinegar, my heart is filled up with adversity till it can hold no more.

He felt as if he must die, indeed he thought himself half dead already. All his life was going; he was nearer dead than alive. Death would be welcomed as a relief by those whose depressed spirits make their existence a living death. Are good men ever permitted to suffer thus?

This was no doubt an exaggeration of a depressed spirit ...  [However], since the Saviour became the acquaintance of grief, sorrow has become honourable in a believer's eyes. A life-long sickness may by divine grace prove to be a life-long blessing. Better suffer from childhood to old age than be let alone to find pleasure in sin.\"\n\nThe Psalm ends with \"darkness\". Is darkness the final word in our life? The answer is assuredly no! The darkness in our life is a reminder of our sinful nature; it is a reminder of the sinful world in which we live; it is a reminder of the reality of life on this earth. However, it also directs our eyes to the light of the world, which is Christ Jesus.\n\nLook at the sky, the darker it is, the brighter the stars shine. Christ is our morning star that outshines the darkness. We know of the eternal hope dimly, but one day we shall see Him in His full glory. \"It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is\" (1 John 3:2b)."

As the hymn writer says, \"Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father, there is no shadow of turning with Thee.\"\n\nThe context of this Psalm could be David's desire to build an earthly house for God. However, the LORD said that He would build an eternal one for David. \"And thine [David's] house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever\" (2 Sam. 7:16).\n\n\"I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever\" (v. 1a). \"Forever\" is one of several important words in this psalm - it describes the extent of God's faithfulness.\n\nCHS: \"This was the ground of the Psalmist's confidence in God's mercy and truth, for he knew that the LORD had made a covenant of grace with David and his seed, and confirmed it by an oath. The oath sworn to David has not been broken, though the temporal crown is no longer worn, for in the covenant itself his kingdom was spoken of as enduring for ever. In Christ Jesus there is a covenant established with all the LORD's chosen, and they are by grace led to be the LORD's servants, and then are ordained kings and priests by Christ Jesus.\"\n\nWhat are the mercies of this covenant? Thomas Chisholm's hymn gives us a glimpse:\n\nPardon for sin and a peace that endureth,\nThine own dear presence to cheer and to guide,\nStrength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,\nBlessings all mine with ten thousand beside.\n\nThese should make us look at God's faithfulness not merely as an attribute, but as a real spiritual blessing for Christians."

The Psalmist proves the faithfulness of God by His power in creation.\n\nThe heavens and the earth are His work and property. God owns them all, as well as everything that springs from the earth. The implications are that there is no reality outside of God, and that there is no other basis for the existence of the universe; it also means that God has a right to dispose of His creation as He pleases. God has a mighty hand to accomplish what He has purposed. His power is great; His skill is incomparable; and His work is glorious.\n\nHow fearful would be such power indeed if it resides in the hand of a tyrant! But God's mighty hand is also merciful. He Who is omnipotent is also faithful in His mercy.\n\nCHS: Justice and judgement \"are the basis of the divine government, the sphere within which His sovereignty moves. God as a sovereign is never unjust or unwise. He is too holy to be unrighteous, too wise to be mistaken; this is constant matter for joy to the upright in heart ... [Mercy and truth] are the harbingers and heralds of the LORD; He calls these to the front to deal with sinners; He makes them, in the person of the Lord Jesus, to be His ambassadors ... If mercy had not paved the way, the coming of God to any man must have been swift destruction.\"\n\nThus blessed are you \"that know the joyful sound: they [you] shall walk, O LORD, in the light of Thy countenance\" (v. 15)."

And curious readers would soon find that in the fine print, the \"it\" referred to God's salvation; thus rendering saving grace a man's choosing. The Psalmist says otherwise - it was God Who chose David.\n\nCHS: \"David was discovered by the LORD among the sheepfolds and recognised as a man of gracious spirit, full of faith and courage, and therefore fit to be leader in Israel ... The verse must also be expounded of the Prince Emmanuel; He became the servant of the LORD for our sakes, the Father having found for us in His person a mighty deliverer ... We have not a Saviour self-appointed and unqualified, but One sent of God and divinely endowed for His work. Our Saviour Jesus is also the LORD's Christ, or anointed. The oil with which He is anointed is God's own oil, and holy oil; He is divinely endowed with the Spirit of holiness.\"\n\nGod's sovereign choice applies also to the redeemed. God has chosen us for salvation when there was nothing good in us. He saved us according to His good pleasure. With our election, there is the unfolding of more spiritual grace  -  God also strengthens our faith (v. 21; Phil. 4:13); He protects us from the wiles of the devil (v. 22; Eph. 6:11); He gives us the victory (v. 23; 1 Cor. 15:57); He exalts the faithful (vv. 24-27); and He extends His blessings to our children (v. 28-29).\n\nGoing back to the evangelistic campaign slogan mentioned earlier, a better one would have been - \"Have you been found?\" Praise God that He has found us because to be found by God means that we can never be lost; and to be kept by His covenant means that we will never fall from grace."

        "text": "The theme of the eighty-ninth psalm is God's faithfulness. He is faithful in the heavens and on the earth. He is faithful to Israel. He is faithful in His covenant with David. However, the LORD will not condone the sins of His people. If they break His laws, they will be disciplined (vv. 30-32). Yet, God remains faithful even in discipline. The love of God will outweigh His judgement. His discipline may even be severe, but it will not be permanent. \"Nevertheless My lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer My faithfulness to fail\" (v. 33).\n\nCHS: \"A glorious nevertheless ... And a glorious fear-killing sentence! This crowns the covenant with exceeding glory. Mercy may seem to depart from the LORD's chosen, but it shall never altogether do so ... [In Christ and] under the most trying circumstances, the LORD's lovingkindness to each one of His chosen will endure the strain ... God may leave His people, and they may thereby suffer much and fall very low, but utterly and altogether He never can remove His love from them; for that would be to cast a reflection upon his own truth ... This passage sweetly assures us that the heirs of glory shall not be utterly cast off. We believe in the Gospel rod, but not in the penal sword for the adopted sons.\"\n\nNo discipline is pleasant. \"Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby\" (Heb. 12:11). But discipline is like keeping the strings on the violin taut, so that the sound from the instrument is crisp and bright. Likewise when God disciplines, He is keeping our heart-strings in tune so that our lives may sing His praises."

For the next eight verses, his hymn of \"Great is Thy Faithfulness\" turns into \"Does Jesus Care?\"\n\nWe do not know of the historical context which gives the reason for the Psalmist's change in tone. Whatever the circumstances, the Psalmist regarded them as a sign that God had forsaken the sons of David and had \"made void the covenant\" (v. 39).\n\nCHS: \"The 'divinity which doth hedge a king' had departed. Hitherto, the royal family had been like a vine within an enclosure, but the wall was now laid low, and the vine was unprotected. It is sorrowfully true that in many places the enclosures of the church have been destroyed, the line of demarcation between the church and the world has almost vanished, and godless men fill the sacred offices. Alas, O LORD God ... shall Thy true vine be deserted by Thee? ... God of truth, wilt Thou not arise and tread down falsehood? Set up the boundaries again, and keep Thy church as a vineyard reserved for Thyself.\"\n\nWhen our faith in God is shaken by adversities, it is good to pause - selah -  and remind ourselves that God is present even in the midst of the storm. If He were not, life would be just a series of random and meaningless events. If there is no God, then suffering and death, even good times, have no purpose. But God is present, and He is sovereign. He is the author behind every event, and although we may not understand His ways, we know that \"to every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven\" (Eccl. 3:1)."

        "text": "\"How long, LORD? Wilt Thou hide Thyself for ever?\" (v. 46a). This is a question that suffering Christians often ask. To this cry, the Psalmist gives two reasons why God must act soon. First, the enemies are emboldened by God's \"silence\" (vv. 50-51); and second, life is short.\n\nCHS: \"All must die ... [No man can] elude the arrows of death ... Neither by strength, wisdom, or virtue can any man escape the common doom, for to the dust return we must. Since then we must all die, do not make this life all wretchedness, by smiting us so long, O LORD ... [Do not desert us] in this brief span [of life] that we shall be quite unable to testify to Thy faithfulness: make us not feel that we have lived in vain. Thus the brevity of life and the certainty of death are turned into pleas with the Most High.\"\n\nPaul says, \"The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on Me\" (Rom. 15:3b), and as God's people, we must be ready to plead for the vindication of God's truth and ways.\n\nThe Psalmist ends with the quiet assurance that our God is forever. He is immutable, meaning to say that God does not change. God's character does not change. He is forever faithful. He is always compassionate and merciful. God's truth does not change. His promises are \"yea, and in Him [Christ] Amen\" (2 Cor. 1:20). God's ways do not change. His dealings with men are true and constant. God's purposes do not change. He will work all things as He had purposed. God's Son does not change. \"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever\" (Heb. 13:8). This is the Christian's surest comfort and eternal security. As the Heidelberg Catechism says, \"The only comfort in life and death is that I belong to my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ.\""

It is also a contrast of the temporal glories of man and the eternal grandeur of God. In the dry and desert climate, a brief spell of rain will cause the wild flowers to bloom, but under the scorching heat of the sun, the flowers will wither in no time. That, Moses says, is the fleeting glory of man. No one knows this truth better than Moses.

Our only reality and surety is God. CHS: \"Moses, in effect, says, 'wanderers though we be in the howling wilderness, yet we find a home in Thee' ... He [Jehovah] shelters, comforts, protects, preserves, and cherishes all His own. Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the saints dwell in their God, and have always done so in all ages. Kings' palaces have vanished beneath the crumbling hand of time ...  but the ever- living Jehovah ... [is] the divine home of the faithful, untouched by so much as the finger of decay. Where dwelt our fathers, a hundred generations since, there dwell we still.\"\n\nIsaac Watts wrote, based on Psalm 90, these words:\n\nO God, our help in ages past,\nOur hope for years to come,\nOur shelter from the stormy blast,\nAnd our eternal home.\nUnder the shadow of Thy throne\nStill may we dwell secure;\nSufficient is Thine arm alone,\nAnd our defense is sure."

In our day, wealthy men pay to have their bodies frozen in the hope of reliving again.

When God was overthrowing the tribes in the wilderness He had their iniquities before Him, and therefore dealt with them in severity. He could not have their iniquities before Him and not smite them.\"\n\nThe man who does not have the reality of God thinks that he can conceal his sins. However, there is no hiding from God. Every sin shall be found out (Num. 32:23). Every evil will be exposed. There are no secrets before God. \"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad\" (Mark 4:22).\n\nIn light of our sinful nature and God's omniscience, our response should neither be concealment of our sins nor confidence in our works. Rather, Moses says that we should pray for wisdom - to know that life is brief and that we should live those brief years well. Christians must take account of our lives. Moses' prayer is that God would enable us to see the whole of life, even the end of it. If we know when, where, and how we would die, this knowledge, no doubt, will affect our living.

To \"number our days\" means more than just knowing the length of our lives And no man can truly say that he has numbered his days and applied his heart unto wisdom until he has learnt to count every day as possibly his last.\n\nWhen Moses tells us to \"number our days,\" it is a prayer for God's help to make every day of our lives count for Him. We know we have lived each day well when we live in full consciousness of God's love, when we find our fullest satisfaction in the Beloved. Practically, it means that we should forget about trying to fill our lives with things because they will perish.

Into the secret place those only come who know the love of God in Christ Jesus, and those only dwell there to whom to live is Christ.\"\n\nTo those whom God is their dwelling place, there is the promise of His divine care. The Psalmist gives two pictures of God's protection. The LORD watches over us like a mother bird gathers her young under her wings, and He protects us like an armour protects the warrior. But the Psalmist adds something more concrete, \"His truth shall be thy shield and buckler\" (v. 4b). God's care for us is sealed by His own promises. His truth will be our security.

There are Christians who emphasise the physical rest from labour and neglect God's injunction to keep the day holy. There can be no true rest if it is not holy rest; for what spiritual benefits can we derive from rest that is not holy?\n\nThe Psalmist understands the real purpose of the Sabbath - to give thanks unto the LORD; to sing praises unto His name; to proclaim His love. Why is it good to praise God?\n\nCHS: \"It is good ethically, for it is the LORD's right; it is good emotionally, for it is pleasant to the heart; it is good practically, for it leads others to render the same homage [worship] ... To give thanks to God is but a small return for the great benefits wherewith He daily loadeth [gives] us ... We thank men when they oblige us, how much more ought we to bless the LORD when He benefits us. Devout praise is always good, it is never out of season, never superfluous, but it is especially suitable to the Sabbath; a Sabbath without thanksgiving [worship] is a Sabbath profaned.\"\n\nIt is good to keep the Sabbath holy because God says so; and it is good because it sets us apart from the brutish man and the fool (v. 6). The Westminster Divines say that \"man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\" Glorifying and enjoyment of God is expressed primarily in our worship. If you do not find the Lord's Day worship enjoyable, it is not because you have come to know God and have found Him boring, but rather, it is because you do not know Him much.

        "text": "Jehovah is King (Psalm 93). The King is also the Judge, which is the theme of the ninety-fourth psalm. God is the One to whom vengeance belongeth, meaning that He is the God of retribution (Rom. 12:19). The Psalmist is asking God to undertake on his behalf; that is vengeance and not revenge. Samuel Johnson, an English writer in the 1700s, makes this distinction. He writes, \"Revenge is an act of passion; vengeance of justice.\" The Psalmist is asking for the latter. He is appealing to God as the righteous Judge to right the wrong, vindicate the innocent and punish the guilty.\n\nCHS: This is \"a very natural prayer when innocence is trampled down, and wickedness exalted on high. If the execution of justice be a right thing ...  then it must be a very proper thing to desire it; not out of private revenge ... but out of sympathy with right, and pity for those who are made wrongfully to suffer ...  Injustice is here attributed to the LORD's being hidden ... God has but to show Himself, and the good cause wins the day.\"\n\nThe Psalmist pleads for God to show Himself because of the impertinence and arrogance of the wicked (vv. 4-6). Not only did they afflict God's people, they also mock God as being blind and indifferent.\n\nThe story is told of a farmer who is strongly anti-Christian. As he plowed his field on Sunday morning, he would shake his fist at the people who passed by on their way to worship. October came and the farmer had his best crop ever. When the harvest was complete, he placed an advertisement in the local paper which read, \"Faith in God must not mean much if someone like me can prosper.\" The response from his Christian neighbours was quiet and polite. In the next edition of the town paper, a small ad appeared. It read, \"God doesn't always settle His accounts in October.\" Vengeance is God's and He will repay."

The Psalmist pleads with them, \"when will ye be wise?\" (v. 8) If the unregenerate heart pays no attention to the Psalmist's concern, would not the unbelieving mind at least consider these truths: God makes the ears and eyes, would He not hear and see? God gives the law, would He not judge? (vv. 9-10). Awake, sinner! God knows the thoughts of every heart, and they are altogether futile (v. 11). This is the folly of any person who acts as if there is no God.\n\nBut for the man who repents, there is hope. Blessed is the man whom God disciplines. CHS: \"Though he may not feel blessed while smarting under the rod of chastisement, yet blessed he is; he is precious in God's sight, or the LORD would not take the trouble to correct him ... Affliction without the Word is a furnace for the metal, but there is no flux to aid the purifying: the Word of God supplies that need, and makes the fiery trial effectual ... The afflicted believer is under tuition, he is in training for something higher and better, and all that he meets with is working out his highest good, therefore is he a blessed man, however much his outward circumstances may argue the reverse.\"\n\nThe Psalmist describes the person whom God disciplines as a \"man\", but not just any man; in Hebrew, it really means a \"valiant man\" - one of strength and character. Such is the \"man\" who is formed by God's refining fires, whose mind has been moulded by the Word of God, and whose heart's purpose is singular toward the LORD. Are you this \"valiant man\"?"

Blessed is the man who trusts in God, and who in the multitude of thoughts turns to Him and finds peace that passeth all understanding.\n\nTurn your eyes upon Jesus,\nLook full in His wonderful face,\nAnd the things of earth will grow strangely dim\nIn the light of His glory and grace."

It reminds us how and why we should worship, and it warns us that the neglect of this spiritual duty and privilege will cause our hearts to harden.\n\nSadly, worship in most churches today is nothing more than a performance. A.W. Tozer writes that in most churches, true worship has been replaced by this \"strange and foreign thing called the 'program.' This word has been borrowed from the stage and applied with sad wisdom to the type of public service which now passes for worship among us.\"\n\nAll worship begins with a desire to come before the presence of the Almighty God. The Psalmist says, \"Let us come.\" It is not enough to worship on your own. True worship and spiritual excitement are contagious.\n\nCHS: \"One can imagine David in earnest tones persuading his people to go up with him to the worship of Jehovah with sound of harp and hymn, and holy delight. The gladsomeness of his exhortation is noteworthy, the noise is to be joyful ... It is to be feared that this is too much overlooked in ordinary services, people are so impressed with the idea that they ought to be serious that they put on the aspect of misery, and quite forget that joy is as much a characteristic of true worship as solemnity itself.\"\n\nThe Psalmist exhorts us to \"make a joyful noise unto Him with psalms.\" Biblical worship must include a combination of sounds (joyful noise) and words (psalms). Of the two, words are crucial. Without the theologically sound words in the worship, all music is mere sound.\n\nThe Psalmist also describes the demeanour by which we should worship. We are to \"bow down ... kneel before the LORD.\" When we worship, we recognise God for Who He is. God is great and He deserves our worship. When we bow down before Him, we recognise ourselves for who we really are. We are His redeemed, and to worship Him must always be a delight."

The man who will not worship God is an infidel. The heart that will not praise the Almighty is a hardened one.\n\nThe essence of true worship is not singing and making joyful noises; rather, it is hearing what God has to say. It is like Mary choosing the good part by quietly sitting at the feet of Jesus and listening to the Master, while Martha cumbered herself with many things. I wonder how many spiritual blessings have passed us by because we were preoccupied with our own things. The Psalmist's counsel is \"Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your heart.\"\n\nWe should not underestimate the significance of this \"if.\" CHS: \"Dreadful 'if.' Many would not hear, they put off the claims of love, and provoked their God. 'Today,' in the hour of grace, in the day of mercy, we are tried as to whether we have an ear for the voice of our Creator. Nothing is said of tomorrow ... He [God] presses for immediate attention, for our own sakes He asks for instantaneous obedience ... [Yield to His love now.] We cannot soften our hearts, but we can harden them, and the consequences will be fatal ... God remembers men's sins, and the more memorably so when they are committed by a favoured people, against frequent warnings, in defiance of terrible judgements, and in the midst of superlative mercies ... Do not seek to turn aside the edge of the warning; thou hast good need of it, give good heed to it.\"\n\nWhat God has graciously offered today, He can judiciously withdraw tomorrow.

The Bible tells us that as the Ark made its way into the city, a jubilant David \"danced before the LORD with all his might\" (2 Sam. 6:14).\n\nCHS: \"New joys are filling the hearts of men, for the glad tidings of blessing to all people are proclaimed; therefore let them sing a new song. Unto the one only God all music is to be dedicated ... Sing unto the LORD, all the earth. National jealousies are dead; a Jew invites the Gentiles to adore, and joins with them, so that all the earth may lift up one common Psalm as with one heart and voice unto Jehovah.\"\n\nDavid invites you to sing unto the LORD a new song. The new song is not one that is new in composition. By the new song, David was not referring to the latest psalm that he had penned. When the Psalmist urges believers to sing God a \"new song,\" he is calling on them to sing about some new thing that God has done, a new blessing that God has bestowed. For David, the new thing that God had done was to move the Ark to Jerusalem.\n\nFor believers, we have a new song to sing unto our Saviour every day, seeing that God's \"compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is Thy faithfulness\" (Lam. 3:22-23). And these are the new songs that will never cease.\n\nYet, there is a new song that is waiting to be sung. Before the throne of the Almighty God, a new song will be sung, \"And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth\" (Rev. 5:9-10).

        "text": "My great-grandfather was a devout idol-worshipper. I remember seeing him kneeling and bowing before an altar of idols in the mornings and evenings, offering incense and praying for blessings. But these idols are merely carved wood. The Hebrew word for \"idols\" means \"good for nothing.\" The idols we worship today do not rest on shelves - they reside in our hearts. They are the things we love more than God, and the things to which we give our first allegiance. But like the idols of wood, these idols of the heart are \"good for nothing.\"\n\nContrast these manufactured idols with Jehovah Who \"made the heavens\" (v. 5), Who alone is \"honour and majesty ...  strength and beauty,\" and to Whom alone we must worship. To worship any but God alone is sin. For this reason, David calls us to worship God because \"the LORD reigneth\" (v. 10).\n\nCHS: \"This is the gladdest news which can be carried to them [the unbelievers] - the LORD Jehovah, in the person of His Son, has assumed the throne ... The dominion of Jehovah Jesus is not irksome, His rule is fraught with untold blessings, His yoke is easy, and His burden is light.\"\n\nThe LORD reigns, and He \"shall judge the people righteously\" (v. 10). Our view of judgement is almost always negative. But the Psalmist says that God's judgement is accompanied with great rejoicing in the heavens and on the earth. Why? Because truth and righteousness will eventually prevail.\n\nThe coming down of the Berlin Wall in 1989 signified the fall of communism - a godless and evil system had collapsed and the free world rightly rejoiced. However, there is a true and greater rejoicing coming when our Lord Jesus returns. We who trust in Him must look to that day of perfect righteousness and truth, and we who are concerned about truth and holiness must have the LORD as our King."

If we get our theology right, God's reign includes the work of His divine justice -  the enemies will be burned up, and the earth will be shaken (vv. 3-5).\n\nCHS: \"States and kingdoms which stand out upon the world like mountains are utterly dissolved when He decrees their end. Systems as ancient and firmly- rooted as the hills pass away when He does but look upon them. Heathenism yielded at the glance of Jehovah Jesus, and the tyrannies based upon it dissolved like melted wax ... His dominion is universal, and His power is everywhere felt ...  In the little world of our nature the presence of Jesus in reigning power is as a fire to consume our lusts and melt our souls to obedience.\"\n\nBut is not God's sovereign power tempered by love? Yes and no. No, because unless God is sovereign and all-powerful, His love would be meaningless. What good is a God Who is willing to love but is hindered from doing so for a lack of power? Yet yes, God's power is tempered by love, but only in Christ Jesus. We are \"accepted [by God only] in the Beloved\" (Eph. 1:6).\n\nThus it is God's sovereign love in His Son that is our greatest comfort. A godly pastor was worried about the future of his ministry that he could not sleep. His wife asked him, \"Do you think God was in this work before you came?\" The man nodded. His wife asked again, \"Do you think God will be in this work after you leave?\" The man nodded again. Then the wife asked, \"So, why do you not think that you can trust Him to be in this ministry while you are around?\" The man immediately understood. The LORD reigns, and our trust in His reign is the wellspring of our hope and comfort."

We cannot love God without hating that which He hates. We are not only to avoid evil, and to refuse to countenance it, but we must be in arms against it, and bear towards it a hearty indignation.

As they [we] keep far from evil so shall evil be kept far from them [us].\"\n\nMan does not naturally hate evil. If anything, we have a propensity to sin. We are intrigued by the crimes that we read in the newspapers and watch on television. As Christians, we must learn to hate evil even as we learn to love God. Richard Sibbes (1577-1635), a Puritan preacher, gives us some thoughts as to how we may know to hate evil:\n\n\"First, a man may know his hatred of evil to be true if it is universal - he that hates sin truly, hates all sin. Secondly, true hatred of sin is fixed - there is no appeasing it but by abolishing the thing hated. Thirdly, true hatred of sin is a more rooted affection than anger - anger may be appeased, but hatred of sin remains and sets itself against the whole kind. Fourthly, if our hatred of sin is true, we hate all evil, in ourselves foremost, and secondarily in others - he that hates a toad, would hate it most in his own bosom. Fifthly, he that hates sin truly, hates the greatest sin in the greatest measure; he hates all evil in a just proportion. Sixthly, our hatred to sin is right if we can endure admonition and reproof for sin, and not be enraged - therefore, those that swell against reproof do not appear to hate sin.\""

The Psalmist does not give us the historical context or reasons for praising God. Perhaps, his intention was to present the psalm as one of pure praise and celebration so that it can be sung on any occasion in the believer's life. There is no better way to prove the theme of joy in Psalm 98 than to point out that Isaac Watt's Joy to the World is based upon it. It is also no coincidence that this psalm is strikingly parallel to Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55).\n\nGod is to be praised for He \"hath done marvellous things\" (v. 1); above all, He is to be praised for our salvation. CHS: \"The LORD is to be praised not only for effecting human salvation, but also for making it known, for man would never have discovered it for himself ... In God's own light His light is seen.

And Heaven and nature sing\nJoy to the earth, the Savior reigns!\nLet men their songs employ ... Repeat the sounding joy.\n\nThere is no secret to God's saving grace. He has made known His salvation to the heathen. It is clearly taught in the Holy Scriptures, and it ought to be plainly preached so that \"all the ends of the earth [would know] the salvation of our God\" (v. 3b). What a loss of blessings it will be to believers if we would not raise our voices to proclaim the salvation of our God; and what greater loss it will be to the sinner if the redeemed kept silent about His gift of grace."

Holiness is that which sets God apart from the rest of His creation. God is holy in the sense of transcendence.\n\nIn the Bible, believers are known as saints. No man is a saint because he has attained a certain level of moral excellence. A man is a saint in the biblical sense of the word because he has been \"set apart\" by God. A saint is one who has been called out by God for service. A saint is one who has transcended. He is in this world, but he is not of it.\n\nGod's holiness has practical implications for us. God is holy; therefore we must be holy too. \"But as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation\" (1 Pet. 1:15). Holiness is not an option for a believer. Second, we are made holy in Christ (1 Thess. 3:13). Third, God's holiness demands our worship - \"Exalt the LORD  ... worship ... for the LORD our God is holy\" (v. 9).

David seems to be setting some principles for himself as the father in his home and as God's anointed king over Israel. The Chinese has a saying: \"Discipline of the self, order in the home, unity in the nation, peace in the world.\" It simply means that before a man can change the world, he has to discipline himself. That is also where David began, \"I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way\" (v. 2).\n\nCHS: \"David's resolve was excellent ... A king had need be both sage and pure ... If he be not so in intent, when he comes to the throne, his after conduct will be a sad example to his people. He who does not even resolve to do well is likely to do very ill.

Piety must begin at home. Our first duties are those within our own abode.

Sadly, David did not live up to his own words (2 Sam. 11). Nevertheless God's word is still true despite man's failures. Nothing is more crucial to the children's spiritual growth than the father's spiritual life. If there is one thing that fathers cannot fail, it is the failure of being godly."

But listen to the words of our Lord Jesus, \"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father ...

The Psalmist used two pictures to illustrate his fading life -  the declining shadow and the withering grass.\n\nCHS: \"His days were but a shadow at best, but now they seem to be like a shadow which was passing away. A shadow is unsubstantial enough, how feeble a thing must a declining shadow be? ... He was like grass, blasted by a parching wind, or cut down with a scythe, and then left to be dried up by the burning heat of the sun. There are times when through depression of spirit a man feels as if all life were gone from him, and existence had become merely a breathing death.\"\n\nBefore the days of mechanical clocks, people tell time by the sun-dial. As the sunlight hits upon the sun-dial, it marks the hour of day. As the sun sets, the shadow becomes less distinct, and it soon vanishes. This is true for the person who does not know our Lord Jesus Christ; and unless he repents, there is a day of darkness from which he will never see the sun again. For the believer, we have this promise from our Saviour, \"I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\" (John 8:12). In Christ, we do not have a declining shadow - what we have is only bright hope."

These may be true of him, but they are certainly not true of God. Whatever the Psalmist is, God is not.\n\nAfter a long list of complaints, the Psalmist abruptly stops. It is as if he has been falling, and he has finally reached rock bottom; he looks up, and he sees the eternal God sitting on His throne.\n\nCHS: The Psalmist's \"mind is turned away from his personal and relative troubles to the true source of all consolation, namely, the LORD Himself, and His gracious purposes towards His own people ... The sovereignty of God in all things is an unfailing ground for consolation; He rules and reigns whatever happens, and therefore all is well ... All things else are vanishing like smoke, and withering like grass, but over all the one eternal, immutable light shines on, and will shine on when all these shadows have declined into nothingness.\"\n\nListen to the Psalmist's praise - \"But Thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever.\" It is not man that shall endure forever but God. We think we have the right to live forever. The reality is that we perish. Yes, God can and is able to heal and extend our days on earth. When we are sick, we should ask God to heal. However, here is a more blessed truth which the Psalmist, lying on his sick bed, finally understood - that there is an eternal God Who knows us by name and remembers us as long as He lives."

This is the blessed promise that the Psalmist wants to make known not just to the heathen (v. 15) but also for generations to come (v. 18).\n\nWith this turning point in the Psalmist's life comes also a transformed perspective. Before, we see, in the Psalmist, a man preoccupied with himself; now, we see a man filled with evangelistic zeal. \"God hears prayer.\"\"Jesus saves.\" Write these down because the world and our children also need to know that there is a God Who saves.\n\nCHS: \"A note shall be made of it, for there will be destitute ones in future generations, and it will make glad their eyes to read the story of the LORD's mercy to the needy in former times. Registers of divine kindness ought to be made and preserved; we write down in history the calamities of nations; how much rather than should we set up memorials of the LORD's lovingkindness! Those who ...  [have delivered cannot forget God's mercy, and] they are bound to tell others of it, and especially to instruct their children in the goodness of the LORD.\"\n\nWhat shall we say? Except that there is a God who looks down from heaven \"to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death.\" As in the days of old when God heard the groans of the children of Israel in Egypt and sent Moses to deliver them, so He also sends His Son to save those who call out to Him for forgiveness; and He sends the Holy Spirit to comfort those who look to Him for sustaining grace."

But as tough times roll in, doubts of God's faithfulness begin to set in again, and so he complained again, \"He weakened my strength ... He shortened my days\" (v. 23).\n\nWeakened strength and shortened days serve their divine purpose when they compel us to look to God in faith and to see Him as the unchanging God in the midst of an ever-changing world. Just as a man who changes his clothes does not change his nature, so the creation changes but the Creator does not change. God is the same.\n\nCHS: \"The Psalmist remembered that when Israel was vanquished, her capital destroyed, and her temple levelled with the ground, her God remained the same self-existent, all-sufficient being, and would restore his people, even as He will restore the heavens and the earth ... 'I am God, I change not, therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed' ... God lives on ... We may lose our dearest earthly friends, but not our heavenly Friend. Men's days are often suddenly cut short, and at the longest they are but few, but the years of the right hand of the Most High cannot be counted ... O my soul, rejoice thou in the LORD always, since He is always the same.\"\n\nJesus is the same yesterday, today and forever (Heb. 13:8). The Psalmist concludes his quest with the confidence that God is unchanging, and His faithfulness extends beyond Himself to His children after Him. \"The children of Thy servants shall continue\" - they will continue to dwell in the Almighty. \"Their seed shall be established before Thee.\" As sure as God is unchangeable, so will be the safety and welfare of those who trust in Him."

While others may complain about what God had failed to do for them, David blessed the LORD with his whole being. He listed God's goodness and numbered His blessings. Dear reader,\n\nCount your blessings, name them one by one,\nCount your blessings, see what God hath done!\nCount your many blessings, every doubt will fly ... \nCount your many blessings. Wealth can never buy ... \nCount your blessings ... \nAnd it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.\n(Johnson Oatman, Jr.)\n\nThere is a benefits-package for every child of God - forgiveness of sins, restoration of the body, redemption of the soul, blessings of mercies, provision of every good thing, and renewing of strength.\n\nCHS: \"Many a worldling is satiated, but not one is satisfied. God satisfies the very soul of man, his noblest part, his ornament and glory ... Our good LORD bestows really good things, not vain toys and idle pleasures; and these he is always giving, so that from moment to moment he is satisfying our soul with good.\"\n\nThe soul who is satisfied by God will be the soul who worships Him. The mouth that has tasted the sweetness of God's saving grace is bound to glorify Him Who fills it. An ever-flowing spring of blessings calls for ever-flowing songs of praise. This is the Christian's eternal employment; we will never cease to praise Him because God will never cease to bless us."

Sin is removed from us by a miracle of love! What a load to move, and yet it is removed so far that the distance is incalculable. Fly as far as the wing of imagination can bear you, and if you journey through space eastward, you are further from the west at every beat of your wing. If sin be removed so far, then we may be sure that the scent, the trace, the very memory of it must be entirely gone. If this be the distance of its removal, there is no shade of fear of its ever being brought back again ... Our sins are gone, Jesus has borne them away.\"\n\nChristian, rejoice in every good gift, but rejoice above all for the best of them - the forgiveness of sins.

We often think more highly of ourselves than we ought to (Rom. 12:3), over-estimate our strength, overrate our intelligence. There are parents who are guilty of being unmindful of the infirmities of their children, and impose upon them burdens too heavy for their age. Not so with God. He knows our frame. He is the omnipotent Father Who knows the weakness of His children. So our Heavenly Father never overloads us, and never fails to give us strength that is equal to our day, because He always takes our frailty into account when He is apportioning to us our lot. Blessed be His holy Name for this gentleness towards His frail creatures.\n\nGod knows how much we can take; He knows the weight of burden that we can carry.

His throne is fixed, for that is the word; it is established, settled, immovable ... [God's power is not delegated. He sits supreme on His throne.] He now reigns universally, He always has done so, and He always will. To us the world may seem rent with anarchy, but He brings order out of confusion ... Great and small, intelligent and material, willing and unwilling, fierce or gentle - all, all are under His sway ...  He is the blessed and only Potentate, King of kings and Lord of lords.\"\n\nHence, David concludes this song with the same words that he began with. \"Bless the LORD, O my soul.\" This is the evidence of a redeemed man. We need to examine ourselves whether or not there is real praise for God in our hearts. We say \"Amen\" to the prayers of the worship leader, but do we really hear? We listen to the singing of the choir, but do we praise along? We listen to the preaching of the minister, but do we really hear? Spiritual lukewarmness is a common disease in our churches. If that is our condition, we need to come before God, as David did, and we need to stir up our hearts for God and to bless Him."

        "text": "The one hundred third and fourth psalms are considered twins, both beginning with \"Bless the LORD, O my soul.\" In the former, David sings of the goodness of God in salvation, and God is portrayed as a Father to His children; in the latter, the Psalmist praises the greatness of God in creation, and God is exalted as the Creator. The first four verses parallel the first two days in the Creation account (Gen. 1). The intent of the Psalmist was not to show the sequence of creation, but the splendour of the Creator - God is very great; He is clothed with honour and majesty; He is draped in light.\n\nCHS: \"The declaration of Jehovah's greatness here given would have been very much in place at the end of the psalm, for it is a natural inference and deduction from a survey of the universe ... The wonder expressed does not refer to the creation and its greatness, but to Jehovah Himself. It is not 'the universe is very great!' but 'THOU art very great.'\"\n\nGod Himself cannot be seen, but the beauty of nature is like His royal robe that reveals His majesty and honour. One must be blind indeed who does not see that nature is the work of the Master Craftsman; and one is gravely mistaken who identifies God with nature, worshipping the sun and moon and thinking that he is actually worshipping God. Unfortunately, some brand of modern day environmentalism is actually ancient pantheism in new garb.\n\nThe God of the Bible, on the other hand, transcends nature. God clothes Himself in light, and this reflected beauty is enough evidence of God's glory. Truly, the Psalmist is right when he declares, \"O LORD, my God, Thou art very great.\""

The prophet Isaiah says, \"Seek ye the LORD while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near\" (Isa. 55:6). Lest we think we can draw near to God on our own, the Bible tells us that we are \"made nigh [to God] by the blood of Christ\" (Eph. 2:13b), and that we only seek the LORD because \"the Father seeketh such to worship Him\" (John 4:23b)."

        "text": "God called for a famine (v. 16), and He sent Joseph (v. 17). God so ordered by His providence that Joseph was sent before his brothers into Egypt so that he might deliver them out of the famine. But Joseph was sent to Egypt as a slave by the wicked conspiracy of his brothers. God made use of their evil to accomplish His good. In the same way, He makes use of the passions of sinners at all times to execute His plans. Men are free in their wickedness; but God is equally free in frustrating their schemes and overruling their designs for His own purposes.\n\nGod was with Joseph in the prison as He would be in the palace (Gen. 39:2, 21). The enslavement (v. 20) was part of God's refining and purifying process for Joseph.\n\nCHS: \"God has His times, and His children must wait till His 'until' is fulfilled. Joseph was tried as in a furnace, until the LORD's assaying work was fully accomplished. The word of the chief butler was nothing, he had to wait until God's word came, and meanwhile ... [Joseph's] faith was sorely exercised. A delayed blessing tests men, and proves their metal, whether their faith is of that precious kind which can endure the fire ... There is a trying word and a delivering word, and we must bear the one till the other comes to us.\"tin Luther, in his time of sufferings, wrote, \"The supreme blessing in which one can truly know the goodness of God is that He will be gracious to us for the sake of His Son. To someone who properly appreciates this blessing, everything else is a trifle. Though he is despised, he sees that he keeps more than he has lost. If he is poor, he knows that he has a gracious God; if he is sick, he knows that he is called to eternal life. His heart has this constant consolation: Only a short time, and everything will be better.\" Like Joseph, we must learn to endure our afflictions because we have a covenant-keeping God."

        "text": "God always had the right man for the right moment. He called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees and He chose Jacob (v. 6). Before famine hit the land, God sent Joseph (v. 17). And when Pharaoh turned his heart against Israel, God sent Moses and Aaron.\n\nCHS: \"When the oppression was at the worst, Moses came. For the second time we have here the expression, 'He sent'; He Who sent Joseph sent also Moses and his eloquent brother. The LORD had the men in readiness and all he had to do was to commission them and thrust them forward. They were two, for mutual comfort and strength, even as the apostles and the seventy in our Lord's day were sent forth two and two. The men differed, and so the one became the supplement of the other, and together they were able to accomplish far more than if they had been exactly alike: the main point was that they were both sent, and hence both clothed with divine might.\"\n\nWhom God sent, He would also equip. Moses and Aaron were God's messengers. \"They shewed His signs among them\" - literally, it means \"they placed among them the words of His signs\". Moses and Aaron gave Pharaoh the words of God's miracles. They spoke by the command of God, and their words were performed by the power of God.\n\nLikewise, as God's messengers, our job is to place among the unbelievers the words of His grace. His words, and not ours; His truth and not our opinions. Campbell Morgan was known for his gift of Bible exposition. His preaching made him popular. One evening, as he sat in his study, he felt God saying to him, \"What are you going to be, a preacher or My messenger?\"\n\nAs Morgan pondered the question, he realised that his desire to become a \"great preacher\" was hindering his work. For several hours Morgan sat struggling with God's call and his own ambition. Finally he said, \"Thy messenger, my Master - Thine!\" He took the precious outlines of his sermons which he was proud of, and set them aflame. As the outlines were burning, Morgan prayed, \"If Thou wilt give me Thy words to speak, I will utter them from this day forward, adding nothing to them, taking naught away. Thine whole counsel I will declare, so help me God!\""

        "text": "The Egyptians were pantheists. They worshipped a myriad of gods and goddesses. These deities were all linked to the three forces of nature that were vital to Egypt, namely the Nile river, the land, and the sky. When God wrought the plagues upon Egypt, the purpose was to show the superiority of Jehovah over the Egyptian gods.\n\nWith each plague, the intensity of the suffering increased. God also targeted the plagues at the Egyptians, sparing the children of Israel. The final plague was the worst of all. Pharaoh was told that God would pass through the land, and the first-born of every household from Pharaoh's to the lowliest slave would die.\n\nThe Egyptians had suffered so many plagues, but none brought as much sorrow throughout the land as this. In the end when the Israelites left, the Egyptians were glad to see them go.\n\nCHS: The Egyptians \"feared His people and were glad to pay them to be gone. What a change from the time when the sons of Jacob were the drudges of the land, the offscouring of all things, the brickmakers whose toil was only requited by the lash or the stick. Now ... Pharaoh's wickedness was foiled [and the children of Israel feared].\"\n\nPharaoh represents the man to whom God has spoken directly and repeatedly. There is no man to whom God's Word has been more personal, plain and pointed. But it took ten plagues, much suffering and sorrows before Pharaoh's heart would yield. And all the while, Moses persevered. Often times, it takes more than a word before unbelievers would receive your witness for our Lord Jesus. Similarly, it often takes more than a sermon before believers submit to God and do what they know they must do."

The LORD did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people ... But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers ... \" (Deut. 7:6-8).\n\nThis is the doctrine of God's sovereign and unconditional election, without which no man will be saved. The hymn writer, Robert Lowry, says, \"Nothing can for sin atone ... Naught of good that I have done ... Nothing but the blood of Jesus.\" God's election is unconditional in that those whom He had elected were not better than those whom He did not elect. Conversely, those whom He did not elect were not any worse than those whom He had elected. The elect and the non-elect were sinners alike. The difference between them is the evidence and the effect of God's sovereign grace.\n\nCHS: God remembered His holy promise. \"The covenant and he for whose sake it was made are ever on the heart of the Most High. He remembered His people because He remembered His covenant ... And He brought forth His people with joy ... Up from the wilderness He led them, rejoicing over them Himself and making them rejoice too.\"\n\nGod redeems His elect because it pleases Him to do so. Also, God redeems us so that we can praise Him. Above all, God redeems us so that we might \"observe His statutes, and keep His laws\" (v. 45). As God's chosen children, we are His peculiar people not in the sense of being exclusive or elitist, but that we are to be like Him, that we might be as holy as He is. \"But as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy\" (1 Pet. 1:15-16)."

        "text": "The one hundred fifth and sixth psalms are two ways to tell the same story of Israel. In the former, the story is told from God's perspective, and demonstrates God's faithfulness to the covenant that He has made with Abraham; whereas in the latter, the story is related from the view of Israel, and her unfaithfulness. The two psalms set the darkness of man against the light of God. It is against this background of our sinfulness that the mercy and grace of God is seen in their full glory. Thus, as God's redeemed, we are called to give Him our unrestrained praise.\n\nCHS: \"Our meditation dwells upon human sin; but on all occasions and in all occupations it is seasonable and profitable to praise the LORD ... We praise the LORD truly when we give Him thanks for what we have received from His goodness ... [God's] goodness towards sinners assumes the form of mercy ...  Since man ceases not to be sinful, it is a great blessing that Jehovah ceases not to be merciful. From age to age the LORD deals graciously with His church, and to every individual in it He is constant and faithful in His grace, even for evermore.\"\n\nWhen Israel sinned, God disciplined them severely, but He never cast her aside. This is the story of the believer as well; \"where sin abounded, grace did much more abound\" (Rom. 5:20b). When we look at our own lives, we will realise, as Isaiah did, that \"woe is us,\" but wonderful is God's grace. We praise God not because He is wonderful and we are wonderful too. True praise begins when we come to realise that God is good to us when we are bad to Him, that He loves us when we are His enemies and He is merciful to us when we do not deserve His mercy. We praise God for what He has made us to be in spite of what we are."

        "text": "Despite God's loving-kindness, the children of Israel rejected His kingship and resisted His authority. The history of Israel is a history of infidelity from generation to generation. Their fathers sinned, and so did the children. \"We have sinned with our fathers.\" What a timely warning to fathers. Blessed is the father who guides his son in the path of godliness. But what a sad legacy it is when the father cuts a path through the wilderness of sin for his children.\n\nCHS: \"Men may be said to have sinned with their fathers when they imitate them, when they follow the same objects, and make their own lives to be mere continuations of the follies of their sires [fathers] ... We inherit from our fathers much sin and little wisdom; they could only leave us what they themselves possessed ... A long sojourn [stay] among idolaters had blunted the perceptions of the chosen family ... How many of God's wonders are not understood [by fathers and sons] ... What is not understood will soon be forgotten ... It was an aggravation of Israel's sin that when God's mercies were so numerous they yet were able to forget them all.\"\n\nThough men \"believe not, yet [God] abideth faithful: He cannot deny Himself\" (2 Tim. 2:13). Despite their unbelief and rebellion, God \"saved them for His Name's sake\" (v. 8a). God parted the Red Sea and delivered the children of Israel; only \"then believed they His words\" (v. 12a).\n\nHowever, their faith was shallow because it was temporal, and it was based upon sight. A faith that needs to see the Word of God perform is not real faith. It is an empirical faith, and praises of such faith are short-lived because there is always the need and the urge to see in order to believe. But as our Lord told Thomas, \"because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed\" (John 20:29)."

        "text": "The chief sin of the children of Israel was rebellion. The root of that sin was discontentment. They were dissatisfied with what God had provided. About a month and half since they left Egypt, the Israelites began to complain against Moses and Aaron, \"Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger\" (Exod. 16:3). God met their complaints by giving manna.\n\nThe people soon got sick of manna, and they \"fell a lusting\" after the foods they ate back in Egypt (Num. 11:4-6). Again God answered their gripe by sending quails into the camp. But with the meat, God also sent a great plague (Num. 11:33).\n\nCHS: \"Prayer may be answered in anger and denied in love. That God gives a man his desire is no proof that he is the object of divine favour, everything depends upon what that desire is ... The meat was poison to them when it came without a blessing; whatever it might do in fattening the body, it was poor stuff when it made the soul lean. If we must know scantiness, may God grant it may not be scantiness of soul ... When wealth grows with many a man his worldly estate is fatter, but his soul's state is leaner. To gain silver and lose gold is a poor increase; but to win for the body and lose for the soul is far worse.\"\n\nDiscontentment causes a man to lose sight of things of true value. Temporal goods become more important than spiritual blessings. He strives for gold but forgets about God. He excels in the world but fails in the Word. When God blesses us materially, let us also be mindful of His grace. In our receiving of gifts, remember to worship the Giver."

        "text": "Discontentment is the root from which springs the bitter fruit of idolatry. While Moses was up on Mount Sinai receiving the law of God, the Israelites turned against Him by building a golden calf (Exod. 32). If sinners would only open their eyes to the folly of idolatry! They bowed down to a calf that they had made, but rejected the LORD Who made them. They revered an idol that fed on grass, but rejected the LORD Who gave them manna. Idolatry is a grave sin. On this occasion, God said that He would destroy the Israelites and start afresh with Moses. Israel would have perished at the foot of Sinai if not for Moses' intercession and God's mercy.\n\nCHS: \"Like a bold warrior who defends the wall when there is an opening for the adversary and destruction is rushing in upon the city, Moses stopped the way of avenging justice with his prayers. Moses had great power with God. He was an eminent type of our Lord ... As the Elect Redeemer interposed between the LORD and a sinful world, so did Moses stand between the LORD and his offending people.\"\n\nGreat was the sin of Israel, but greater was the power of Moses' prayer to turn away God's wrath. In Moses, we see the power of a righteous man's intercession. In Jehovah, we have a God Who still hearkens to the voice of His creatures. This surely ought to move us to pray more fervently for the salvation of our loved ones, for the protection of our children from the wiles of the devil, and for revival for ourselves so that we might rise from the sloth and spiritual apathy to whole-hearted service and victory."

The Israelites' discontentment led them to idolatry until they joined themselves with Baal- peor. Baal-peor was a Moabite idol, whose worship included rituals of gross sexual immorality. The Israelites were full participants in the worship of Baal- peor and \"the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel\" (Num. 25:1-3).\n\nCHS: \"Ritualism led on to the adoration of false gods. If we choose a false way of worship ... [it would not be long before] we choose to worship a false god ... Those who are weary of seeking the living God have often shown a hankering after dark sciences, and have sought after fellowship with demons and spirits. To what strong delusions those are often given up who cast off the fear of God!\"\n\nGod's laws are not to be trifled with. The deception of sin is that it would always take you farther than where you want to go, keep you longer than the time you want to stay, and cost you more than the price you are willing to pay. A new sin brings a new judgement from God. Sinners can invent new vices, but God is not powerless in inventing new judgement. An abominable sin will bring a more severe judgement. Twenty-four thousand people died that day. More would have perished if not for the timely intervention of Phinehas, Aaron's grandson, who demonstrated the sinfulness of wrongdoings and the righteous wrath of God by killing an Israelite who had joined with a Moabite woman (Num. 25:7-8).\n\nSin is like spreading sore, and it can only be stopped if the infected area is cut off. Blessed is the man who has the courage and conviction to take a drastic stand against sin, to remove the eye and to cut off the limb in order to save the soul (Matt. 18:8-9)."

It may not be with the blades of steel that we plunge into the hearts of our children, but rather the slow infusion of the poison of worldliness which numbs their souls to spiritual things. No Christian can court worldly company and copy worldly fashions without being affected by them. The folly of worldly conformity shows itself slowly, but how great an evil it is when it finally appears in full form.

The LORD had often saved them for His holy name's sake, and therefore they feel that when again restored they would render all their gratitude to that saving name ... They [We] have all been spared by His grace, let them [us] all join in the adoration with loud unanimous voice.\"\n\nWhat an assurance of salvation, that God's faithfulness is not nullified by our unfaithfulness.

Deliverance follows prayer most surely ... The LORD was ready to save them ... 'He led them forth by the right way.' There are many wrong ways, but only one right one, and into this none can lead us but God Himself.\"\n\nWithout God, we move about in the wilderness, never finding a city to rest.

Sailing over the deeps of inward depravity, the waste waters of poverty, the billows of persecution, and the rough waves of temptation, they need God above all others, and they find Him.\"\n\nJust as the sailor who has to contend with the ever-changing tides, so we have to contend with the uniqueness of one day from another. But in spite of the changes, there is an unchanging constant - everything is the works and wonders of the LORD. So whether in calm seas or over troubled waters, the best assurance we can have is the truth that we have anchored our souls upon our Lord Jesus.\n\nUpon life's boundless ocean where mighty billows roll,\nI've fixed my hope in Jesus, blest anchor of my soul;\nWhen trials fierce assail me as storms are gathering o'er,\nI rest upon His mercy and trust Him more.\n\nI've anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave,\nI've anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave.\nI've anchored in Jesus, for He hath pow'r to save,\nI've anchored to the Rock of Ages.\n(Lewis E. Jones)"

        "text": "Life is tough and often challenging. Every man, at some point in his life, will have to wander through the desert; walking through the valley of darkness and lingering near the gates of death; lying on beds of affliction and sailing through the storms of life. A man must needs be caught in the oceans amidst a violent storm to appreciate what the Psalmist says about the ones whose \"soul is melted ... reel to and fro ... and are at their wits' end\" (vv. 26-27).\n\nCHS: \"Those who have been on the spiritual deep in one of the great storms which occasionally agitate the soul know what this verse means. In these spiritual cyclones, presumption alternates with despair, indifference with agony! No heart is left for anything, courage is gone, hope is almost dead ...  Their fears drive them out of all power to use their brains ... What more can they do? ... [Here is also a description of the spiritual sailor caught in the storm.] We have staggered frightfully! We could stand to nothing and hold by nothing. We knew not what to do, and could have done nothing if we had known it.\"\n\nAll we could do was to cry unto the LORD (v. 28); and that is all we need to do. God Who sends His word of healing (v. 20) will also send His word of calming. By His word, He commands the waves to rise; and by His word, He speaks the waters to calm.\n\nCHS: \"When God makes peace, it is peace indeed, the peace of God which passeth all understanding.\" It only takes one word of God to calm the troubled soul. Christian, pray that God would work in your heart when we face our storms. Call unto Him and His peace will come."

        "text": "The Psalmist calls on the people to \"praise the LORD for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!\" (v. 31) This hymn of praise recognises the power of God over the affairs of man. His authority has no limits. He can turn the rivers into a desert, and turn the desert into watersprings (vv. 33-35).\n\nSuch is man's life. There are ups and downs. The Shepherd leads His sheep beside green pastures and still waters, and He also leads them through the valley of the shadow of death. Life is an ever ebb and flow of tragedies and triumphs, adversities and blessings; and God is the One Who turns the tides.\n\nCHS: \"With another turn of His hand, He more than restores that which in judgement He took away ... This wonder of mercy is the precise reversal of the deed of judgement, and wrought by the selfsame hand [God]. Even thus in the church, and in each individual saint, the mercy of the LORD soon works wonderful changes where restoring and renewing grace begin their benign work ... When the earth is watered and men cultivate it, cities spring up and teem with inhabitants; when grace abounds where sin formerly reigned, hearts find peace and dwell in God's love as in a strong city. The church is built up where once all was a waste when the LORD causes the broad rivers and streams of Gospel grace to flow forth.\"\n\nIn all life's changing circumstances, there is one great truth - God is sovereign and He exercises His sovereignty in perfect love and wisdom. Thus, no man is brought low or lifted high unless God wills it. For this reason, in good times, we praise Him for His blessings; and in bad times, we praise Him yet the more for His all-sufficient grace."

        "text": "Most people make judgements and decisions based upon what they see and their own human wisdom. The disciples saw the man who was born blind, and they immediately concluded the man's blindness must be due to his sins or the sins of his parents. The disciples were wrong. Christians also have the tendency to judge and decide based upon what we see and know.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with trying to make judgements and understand the mind of God, but we must never forget that God's thoughts and ways will always be higher than ours. At the end of his great thesis on the doctrine of salvation, Paul had to humble himself and declare, \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgements, and His ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the LORD? or who hath been His counsellor?\" (Rom. 11:33-34) There are times when we just have to place our hands over our mouths and say nothing but rejoice in God.\n\nCHS: \"Divine providence causes joy to God's true people; they see the hand of the LORD in all things, and delight [in His justice and grace] ... What can the wicked say? God's providence is often so conclusive in its arguments of fact, that there is no replying or questioning.\"\n\nThe righteous, on the other hand, will see and rejoice. \"Whoso is wise, and will observe these things\" - good and bad - will rejoice regardless because they understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. So let the redeemed rejoice for we see the innumerable proofs of God's love; and in situations when we cannot see, let us trust Him confidently, knowing that in due time, things which are hidden will be made manifest, and the truth will still be that God is full of lovingkindness."

        "text": "The one hundred and eighth psalm is written by David, and it is taken from two of his earlier psalms (57 and 60). The first five verses are taken from Psalm 57:7-11; and the last eight verses from Psalm 60:5-12. Psalm 108 is also known as the \"Warrior's Morning Psalm,\" because David was up early in the morning, and he began the day by praising God. That is the secret of his steadfastness.\n\nCHS: \"Though I [David] have many wars to disturb me, and many cares to toss me to and fro, yet I am settled in one mind and cannot be driven from it. My heart has ... one resolve. Thy grace has overcome the fickleness of nature ...  Even though I have to shout in the battle I will also sing in my soul, and if my fingers must needs be engaged with the bow, yet shall they also touch the ten-stringed instrument and show forth Thy praise ... Only when a thoroughly enraptured soul speaks in the instrument can music be acceptable with God: as mere musical sound the LORD can have no pleasure therein, He is only pleased with the thought and feeling which are thus expressed. When a man has a musical gift, he should regard it as too lovely a power to be enlisted in the cause of sin.\" CHS further quotes Charles Wesley:\n\nIf well I know the tuneful art\nTo captivate a human heart,\nThe glory, LORD, be Thine.\nA servant of Thy blessed will,\nI here devote my utmost skill\nTo sound the praise divine.\n\nWe can only render to Him what He has first given us. This is God's modus operandi. \"My heart is fixed ... for Thy mercy is great\" (vv. 1, 4). David's heart was fixed upon God because he knew that God's heart was fixed upon him. He loved us first so that we may love Him; He saved us so that we may serve Him; He is faithful to us so that we may learn to trust Him. And it is God's faithfulness that is the reason for our unwavering confidence in Him."

        "text": "With the shield of faith, David marched into battle confident of the victories that God had wrought for him. Most of us are not warriors in the military battlefields. However, the Bible tells us that we are also engaged in warfare - a spiritual battle - \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places\" (Eph. 6:12). Our enemy is far more pernicious. Against this enemy, our own strength is insufficient, and the help of man is vain. For this spiritual battle, we need God.\n\nCHS: \"We ought to pray with all the more confidence in God when our confidence in man is altogether gone. When the help of man is vain, we shall not find it vain to seek the help of God ... [Divine] help shall inspire us to help ourselves. Faith is neither a coward nor a sluggard: she knows that God is with her, and therefore she does valiantly; she knows that He will tread down her enemies, and therefore she arises to tread them down in His name. Where praise and prayer have preceded the battle, we may expect to see heroic deeds and decisive victories.\"\n\n\"Through God we shall do valiantly.\" That is our secret support. God is the source from which we draw our strength, courage and wisdom for the battle. Our victory has been won. The prophet Isaiah speaks of a man emerging from the battlefield with his garments stained with blood. Who is this warrior? And He answered, \"I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save\" (Isa. 63:1b). Because our blessed Saviour is that bloodstained warrior, \"thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (1 Cor. 15:57)."

        "text": "To some, the tenor of the one hundred and ninth psalm may seem to run against every fibre of the Christian faith. It is an imprecatory psalm. It is filled with terrible curses. Does not the Bible tell us that Christians are to \"bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not\"? (Rom. 12:14) David begins by asking God to turn away from the prayers of his enemies. Their deeds were wicked. They repaid good with evil and rewarded love with hatred (v. 5). Their words were false and malicious (vv. 2-3).\n\nThere is a common saying that goes: \"Stick and stones can break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\" But this is not true. Words from slanderous lips can leave scars just as deep as those from a blade of steel. James warns that the tongue is like \"a fire, a world of iniquity ... it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell\" (James 3:6).\n\nWhat was David's response to these verbal attacks? \"I give myself unto prayer.\" CHS: \"He did nothing else but pray. He became prayer as they became malice. This was his answer to his enemies, he appealed from men and their injustice to the Judge of all the earth, Who must do right. True bravery alone can teach a man to leave his traducers unanswered, and carry the case unto the LORD.\"\n\nNotice the words \"give myself unto\" are in italics in the Bible, meaning to say that they were added in by the translators. Without them, the force of David's words would have been stronger, \"They are my adversaries: but I prayer.\" \"Prayer\" is not just the noun that describes the action of asking God, but here \"prayer\" is the noun that describes the man. David was a \"pray-er.\""

        "verse": "Let them be before the LORD continually, that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth. (Psalm 109:15)",
        "text": "An imprecation is a curse. Imprecatory psalms are those that invoke curses upon the enemies. Psalm 109 is one of the strongest and most intense imprecatory psalms in the Psalter. It contains more than 20 curses. The imprecatory psalms, like the rest of Holy Scriptures, are included for our admonition (1 Cor. 10:11).\n\nCan Christians justify the use of these imprecatory psalms? We need to take note of several points here. Firstly, it must be noted that David was writing as a king and not as a private citizen. These curses did flow from a personal vendetta but were actually for public vindication. As a king, David had the duty to see that evil must be met with justice. Secondly, David left the work of judgement to God. He did not take vengeance into his own hands. In fact, even when David had the opportunity to kill Saul, he did not do so (1 Sam. 24:10). The Christian must leave judgement to the hands of the righteous Judge, \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the LORD\" (Rom. 12:19b). Thirdly, it is scriptural to desire the punishment of the evil and the rewarding of the good. Lastly, when justice is done and done rightly, it will lead the wicked to seek the LORD, and the righteous to praise Him.\n\nThe hardest section of Psalm 109 is verses 9 to 15, where the curses are extended to the family of the evildoer. Yet it serves as a warning to us - telling us that the effects of our sins are far-reaching. The sinner faces the consequences of his sin, but its ripples may extend to the generations after him.\n\nCHS: David \"wishes that the father's sins may follow up the transgressor and assist to fill the measure of his own iniquities, so that for the whole accumulated load the family may be smitten with utter extinction. A king might justly wish for such an end to fall upon an incorrigible brood of rebels; and of persecutors, continuing in the same mind, the saints might well pray for their extinction; but the passage is dark; and we must leave it so. It must be right or it would not be here.\""

He had malice in his heart towards one who was already sufficiently sorrowful ... Yet no grief excited sympathy in him, no poverty ever moved him to relent. No, he would kill the heart-broken and rob their orphans of their patrimony. To him groans were music, and tears were wine, and drops of blood precious rubies ... So little mercy had he ever shown that he had forgotten how to do it, he was without common humanity, devoid of compassion, and therefore only worthy to be dealt with after the bare rule of justice.\"\n\nIf the evildoer would repent, there is forgiving grace, but if the incorrigible man persists in his wickedness with neither remorse nor signs of repentance, believers would be remiss if they do not pray to God to intervene and deliver. Christians must not fall into the snare of silence just because imprecation seems to run counter to our \"civilised\" minds. Bear in mind the act of imprecation is the last resort against unrelenting and malicious attacks upon a child of God.\n\nCHS: \"David was a man of gentle mould, and remarkably free from the spirit of revenge ... [thus he speaks as the suffering believer whose] great principles needed to be vindicated and great injuries redressed.\" Our prayer is that we stand on God's side and are the ones who cry out for His mercy; and not those who would face His wrath."

Verse 6 tells that Satan will set himself at the right hand of the wicked, abetting to do evil; whereas in verse 31, we read that the LORD will stand at the right of the righteous, abiding to defend and save them.\n\nThe Christian should never cease to pray or praise because God will never be absent when the righteous are put on trial.

The one hundred and tenth psalm is the most quoted psalm in the New Testament, and the first verse is the most quoted verse (Acts 2:34-36; 7:56;1 Cor. 15:25; etc.) Psalm 110 is recognised as one of the greatest messianic psalms.

When Stephen saw Him, Christ was \"standing on the right hand of God\" (Acts 7:55b). When Paul met Christ on the way to Damascus, Paul saw \"a light from heaven ... the brightness of the sun\" (Acts 26:13).

There are some people who would not praise God because they do not know Him. But what is even more tragic is for the people who know Him to praise Him only half-heartedly.\n\nWhy do we worship God? Because His works are great. They are great in number; great in magnitude; great in beauty; and great in goodness. We need only look into the sky and see the vastness of the heavens. And we need look at ourselves to see the intricacies of life. The works of God are great because He is great.

When God wanted to build the tabernacle, He filled certain men \"with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship\" (Exod. 31:3). Wisdom then is a skill - the skill of living a godly life.\n\nIt is a skill that has to come from God Who is the Giver of life. CHS: \"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom. It is the first principle ... To know God so as to walk aright before Him is the greatest of all the applied sciences ...  Obedience to God proves that our judgement is sound. Only a man void of understanding will ever justify rebellion against the holy God. Practical godliness is the test of wisdom.

How foolish then it is for the believer who has the Word of God and yet stumbles through life because he does not have the skill to live for His glory.

Psalm 111 ends with the man who is wise because he fears God; Psalm 112 begins with the man who fears God and is blessed.\n\nThe fear of God is not one which paralyses the man in terror. The fear of God is a profound reverence for the Almighty. We fear God when we stand in awe of His majesty and holiness. The fear of God means we cannot take Him lightly; it means that God is not an incidental part of our lives; it means that the Word of God cannot be peripheral in our thinking and acting. The fear of God means that He and His Word must be central in our lives.\n\nCHS: \"Jehovah is so great that He is to be feared, and He is at the same time so infinitely good that the fear is sweetened into filial love, and becomes a delightful emotion ... There is a slavish fear which is accursed; but that godly fear which leads to delight in the service of God is infinitely blessed ... The man [who fears God] not only studies the divine precepts and endeavours to observe them, but also rejoices to do so ... Holiness is his happiness, devotion is his delight, truth is his treasure ... Ungodly men may in some measure obey the commandments out of fear, but only a gracious man will observe them with delight. Cheerful obedience is the only acceptable obedience ... He who takes pleasure in the command is truly loyal.\"\n\nWhen we consider God's blessings, we often think of material wealth. But God's blessings not only clothe the body but also bathe the soul. Prosperity is a blessing but it is not a proof of godliness. The man who is wise would rather be godly than rich because \"godliness with contentment is great gain\" (1 Tim. 6:6)."

He hopes that he can cope, but he can never be sure.\n\nThe God-fearing man, on the other hand, \"shall never be moved\". This is the stability that comes with faith. He may experience all kinds of surprises in life, but wealth does not make him complacent; deprivation does not make him whine. As Paul says, \"I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound ... I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need\" (Phil. 4:12).\n\nCHS: \"God has rooted and established him so that neither men nor devils shall sweep him from his place. His prosperity shall be permanent, and not like that of the gambler and the cheat, whose gains are evanescent ... his home shall be permanent, and he shall not need to wander from place to place as a bird that wanders from her nest; and even his name shall be abiding, for a good man is not soon forgotten ... He shall have no dread that evil tidings will come, and he shall not be alarmed when they do come ... He is neither fickle nor cowardly ... he may change his plan, but not the purpose of his soul ... [His heart is] fixed in solid reliance upon God.\"\n\nThis is the man whose life is anchored upon Jesus. He does not waver and is not easily tossed about. He is not privileged in the sense that he is spared the adversities of life, but he perseveres because he trusts the LORD Whose righteousness endureth forever."

        "text": "What is God like? This is one of those questions that grandchildren will unsuspectingly ask grandparents. It is a good question, though the trouble is that it is unanswerable. The Westminster Divines give this definition, \"God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in His being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth\" (Westminster Shorter Catechism, Question 4). It is theologically accurate and succinct; but abstract.\n\nIt is impossible to fully describe what God is like. He is like none else. God cannot be compared to anything. He is in a category of His own. He is unique. \"There is none like unto the LORD our God\" (Exod. 8:10b; 9:14). The only way we can relate something about God is to describe Him in terms of what He has done (He creates, He saves) and what He is like (He is like a loving father).\n\nThe Psalmist describes God's greatness by using\"the name of the LORD\"(v. 1). The LORD is YHWH (Yahweh, Jehovah). The LORD is the self-existing, self-sufficient, eternal, and unchangeable God. The LORD is the God Who resides where no man can reach.\n\nCHS: \"In the height of His abode none can be like Him. His throne, His whole character, His person, His being, everything about Him, is lofty, and infinitely majestic, so that none can be likened unto Him ... He dwells so far on high that even to observe heavenly things He must humble Himself. He must stoop to view the skies, and bow to see what angels do.\"\n\nJust think of the extent of His condescension when He was made flesh and dwelt among sinful flesh. Mary sang, \"For He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden\" (Luke 1:48a); Isaiah praised, \"The high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.\" What is God like? There is no complete answer, but it is enough for us to know that He is our Saviour and Friend."

These psalms are sung in connection with the Passover - the first two before the meal and the remaining four after it. The theme of this psalm is the Exodus - a familiar subject - but the Psalmist presents the event from God's perspective.\n\nIn this psalm, we read nothing about the struggles of Israel - only the success of Israel's God. We read nothing about the unfaithfulness of the people - only the unwavering love of God. \"Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion\" (v. 2). No nation in man's history was ever a theocracy except Israel. God had set His eye and heart upon Israel - she was to be a nation of priests (Exod. 19:6). Alas, unfaithfulness robbed her of that honour. However, there is a peculiar people who has been made priests - the church which is the body of believers (1 Pet. 2:9). \"The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof\" (Ps. 24:1a). Thus, it is no wonder that the whole creation trembles at God's amazing love.\n\nCHS: The Psalmist calls on \"all nature again to feel a holy awe because its Ruler is still in its midst ... Let the believer feel that God is near, and he will serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling. Awe is not cast out by faith, but the rather it becomes deeper and more profound. The LORD is most reverenced where He is most loved.\"\n\nTremble, the whole creation must in the presence of God. But you who have also known His saving grace tremble not in fear of His wrath, but in faith, as we join the Psalmist in praising God for His provision of the Paschal Lamb."

At the same time, what utter foolishness it is to boast of their gods who had to be fashioned with their own hands.\n\nCHS: \"Their idols are silver and gold, mere dead inert matter; at the best only made of precious metal, but that metal quite as powerless as the commonest wood or clay. The value of the idol shows the folly of the maker in wasting his substance ... [The value of the material] does not increase the power of the image, since there is no more life in silver and gold than in brass or iron ...  Inasmuch as the maker is always greater than the thing that he has made, these idols are less to be honoured than the people who fashioned them. How irrational that men should adore that which is less than themselves! How strange that a man should think that he can make a god!\"\n\nThe gods of the modern man do not rest on shelves; instead they reside in our hearts and minds. They are fashioned by men's ideas. A god who is fashioned by our own thoughts is no more a god than the image made by our own hands. The ultimate folly of idolatry is that the idolaters eventually become like the idols - dumb and dead. The idolaters sank so low that they could not see the foolishness in confiding in images of wood and stone, and in believing the abstractions that they have conjured themselves.\n\nChristians are forbidden to worship idols (Second Commandment); nevertheless, we must never diminish the LORD and pigeon-hole Him into a god of our own liking. God is to be worshipped not just for what He has done for us, but also for Who He is."

        "text": "The heathen worship idols. They put their trust in a chunk of stone or a block of wood. Their faith is as misplaced as it is foolish.\n\nThe Christian worships the true and living God. The Psalmist expresses the Christian's worship as trusting God. To worship God is to ascribe honour to Him. Worship of God is an essential part of religion. Prayer is an essential part of religious worship. And prayer entails trust. It is foolish to pray without trusting. Thus the Psalmist repeatedly sounds the exhortation - trust in the LORD (vv. 9-11).\n\nCHS: \"'Trust in the LORD,' whether belonging to Israel, or to the house of Aaron, or not, all those who reverence Jehovah are permitted and commanded to confide in Him ... These repeated exhortations were rendered necessary by the trying condition in which the children of Israel were found ... All this would be very staggering to faith, and therefore they were bidden again and again and again to trust in Jehovah ... [Likewise, in the age of blasphemy,] the skeptic is loud in unbelief, [but] let us be equally open in the avowal of our faith.\"\n\nTo trust God is to obey Him. To trust God is to put our lives into His hand. When we come to the point where we see no road ahead of us, we hold to God all the more tightly, so that He becomes our help and shield. This is the trust that opens the door of God's blessings. God will bless those who put their trust in Him. This promise is repeated four times. Regardless of your background and status, as you trust in God, He will bless. Where He has blessed once, He will continue to bless without ceasing. More blessings will in turn evoke deeper trust and fervent worship. This is the holy cycle of a Christian's spiritual growth."

Not all will be saved, but everyone -  regardless of his station in life - who puts his trust in the Son of God will be.\n\nGod also blesses both great and small with \"all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ\" (Eph. 1:3b). This means that spiritual growth is not restricted to a select few. On the contrary, it is God's desire to bless. The only hindrance comes from us - we have not because we ask not (James 4:2), and we ask not because we trust Him not. But to all who trust in the LORD, He \"giveth to all men liberally\" (James 1:5). God blesses even in death. \"Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints\" (Ps. 116:15) - both great and small alike.\n\nOur response in light of God's blessings is to praise Him. The spiritually dead cannot praise the LORD. CHS: \"'The dead praise not the LORD' ... They cannot unite in the Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with which the church delights to adore her Lord. The preacher cannot magnify the LORD from his coffin, nor the Christian worker further manifest the power of divine grace by daily activity while he lies in the grave ... The tomb sends forth no voice ... [from there] arises no sound of gospel ministry.\"\n\nIf Christians would not praise God, then who will? If we do not praise now, then when should we? The ministry of worship here is the work of believers, and the time of ministry is now. \"We will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.\" We who have been redeemed and are still living must continue in our praises for God."

        "text": "The one hundred and sixteenth psalm is an intensely personal psalm, in which the Psalmist reveals his fears of dying but ends with an affirmation of God's faithfulness. The context of this psalm tells us that the Psalmist was afflicted with a sickness so severe that he thought he was going to die, but God delivered him. Hence, the Psalmist's opening declaration is, \"I love the LORD\" (v. 1).\n\nWhat grounds did the Psalmist have for speaking with such confidence? First, \"I love the LORD\" is a reflection of a greater truth - it is God Who first loved us. Second, the Psalmist had a record of God's faithfulness in his life. The Psalmist's experience of answered prayers prompted him to call upon the LORD as long as he lived (v. 2). Thus when death pounded on his door, the Psalmist instinctively called upon God, \"LORD; O LORD, I beseech Thee, deliver my soul\" (v. 4).\n\nCHS: \"In hearing prayer the grace and righteousness of Jehovah are both conspicuous. It is a great favour to hear a sinner's prayer, and yet since the LORD has promised to do so, He is not unrighteous to forget His promise and disregard the cries of His people ... 'Yea, our God is merciful' ... He would never have been our God if He had not been merciful.\"\n\nGod's grace, righteousness and mercy come in great supply - not to the wise fool but to the simple in faith. The Septuagint translates \"simple\" in this verse as \"babes\", implying those who have no guile and worldly craftiness. The simple trust in God; and He preserves them. The simple are brought low, but the LORD does not pass them by. What a blessing it is to know that the God of the universe stops by us and stoops to help when we have fallen."

        "text": "The faith of the Psalmist is greatly tested, and it is not found wanting. The greater the testing is, the stronger his declaration of faith. \"I believed, therefore have I spoken.\" It was a testing that revealed to the Psalmist the futility of man. His friends and family, on whom he might presume to rely on for help, had failed him. The sweet words of friendship remained just words. Hence, he lamented, \"All men are liars.\"\n\nBut not God. The trying times and the fair-weather friends stand in great contrast to the faithful God. The afflictions affirmed the Psalmist's faith in God and afforded the opportunity to teach and testify of his faith. It was a faith that said \"I believe even ... \"\n\nCHS: \"Though greatly afflicted, the Psalmist had not ceased to believe: his faith was tried but not destroyed. 'I could not have spoken thus if it had not been for my faith: I should never have spoken unto God in prayer, nor have been able now to speak to my fellow men in testimony if it had not been that faith kept me alive, and brought me a deliverance ... Concerning the things of God no man should speak unless he believes ... the most powerful speech which has ever been uttered by the lips of man has emanated from a heart fully persuaded of the truth of God.'\"\n\nLearn from the Psalmist. There are some whose faith in the LORD fails when tested. They become cynical. Such faith is weak (Prov. 24:10). The Psalmist's faith, on the other hand, is strengthened by testing (James 1:3-4). The cup of testing may be bitter, but to the one who trust in God, there is also the cup of salvation. In his hour of crisis, the Psalmist became a true believer; what will you become?"

The evolutionist sees death of a man as a part of a natural process, no different from the beast in the field. The heathen fear dying because it brings an uncertain and dreadful future. But to a child of God, death is deliverance. If we have walked before Him in the land of the living, we need not fear to die before Him when the hour of our departure is at hand. God manifests His mercy by deliverance, and the final deliverance from the sorrows and pains of life is death.\n\nCHS: \"'Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.' They shall not die prematurely; they shall be immortal till their work is done ... Those who are redeemed with His precious blood are so dear to God that even their deaths are precious to Him. The death-beds of saints are very precious to the church, she often learns much from them; they are very precious to all believers, who delight to treasure up the last words of the departed; but they are most of all precious to LORD Jehovah Himself ... The LORD watches over their dying beds, smooths their pillows, sustains their hearts, and receives their souls.\"\n\nThe Psalmist says that the LORD looks at the death of the saints as precious, meaning that the LORD regards the death of His redeemed as something of great value. There are great purposes to be accomplished by it. There is great glory associated with it. God loves us so much that when He removes His children from this world, it is an act of predetermined purpose to achieve some great end. What ends could death achieve? The departed saint adds to the hosts of heaven. Death proves the veracity of Holy Scripture. Above all, the death of the saint demonstrates the glorious victory of redemption."

        "text": "Psalm 117 is the shortest in the whole psalter, but it contains the grandest theme in the Bible - the enduring love of God. The Psalmist calls on all the nations and all the people to praise God; in other words, it was a call issued to the whole world - Jews and Gentiles alike (John 3:16).\n\nCHS: God's merciful kindness is great toward us. \"By which is meant not only His great love towards the Jewish people, but towards the whole family of man. The LORD is kind to us as His creatures, and merciful to us as sinners, hence His merciful kindness to us as sinful creatures. In Christ Jesus, God has shown mercy mixed with kindness, and that to the very highest degree ... He has kept His covenant promise that in the seed of Abraham should all nations of the earth be blessed, and He will eternally keep every single promise of that covenant to all those who put their trust in Him.\"\n\nIn expressing the greatness of God's love, the Psalmist uses a term that describes God's love through its power to prevail over all situations and people. God's love is so great it prevails over all adversities. God's love is so great it prevails over our sins. Paul says, \"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord\" (Rom. 8:38-39).\n\nGod's love prevails, and His truth endures forever for all peoples in all nations. What can man do but to praise Him? Isaac Watts' hymn would be appropriate in this light:\n\nFrom all that dwell below the skies,\nLet the Creator's praise arise;\nLet the Redeemer's Name be sung,\nThrough every land, by every tongue.\n\nEternal are Thy mercies, LORD;\nEternal truth attends Thy Word.\nThy praise shall sound from shore to shore,\nTill suns shall rise and set no more."

The call to worship was also issued to all who fear the LORD.\n\nCHS: \"If there were any throughout the world who did not belong to Israel after the flesh, but nevertheless had a holy fear of God, the Psalmist calls upon them to unite with him in thanksgiving ...

[Christians should count it our greatest joy to speak of the glory of God.] We should shout 'Hosanna' and sing loud 'Hallelujahs'.\" We should all affirm the end of every prayer with a thunderous \"Amen.\"\n\nThe person who is timid in his praises for God is telling the world he is fearful of man, and showing his lack of reverence for God. Christians are to fear God, proclaim His mercy, and we are to do it now. There is no better time like the present to tell the world about the goodness of God. \"Now\" also means always. To praise God now is to never cease from praising.\n\nCan a Christian stop praising God? Hardly, it is remiss on our part to cease praising God Whose mercy never ceases. The seventeenth century British poet, John Milton, captures this theme of unceasing praise with these words:\n\nLet us, with a gladsome mind,\nPraise the LORD, for He is kind.\nFor His mercies aye endure,\nEver faithful, ever sure.\n\nLet us blaze His Name abroad,\nFor of gods He is the God.\nFor His mercies aye endure,\nEver faithful, ever sure."

The Psalmist who fears God (v. 4) is fearful of nothing else (v. 6). Martin Luther is especially fond of this Psalm. He called it his own beloved psalm. He wrote, \"When emperors and kings, the wise and the learned, and even saints could not aid me, this psalm proved a friend and helped me out of many great troubles. As a result, it is dearer to me than all the wealth, honour, and the power of the pope.\"\n\nVerse 6 is one that was used by many martyrs who perished during the Sixteenth Century Reformation. The question was asked, \"What can man do unto me?\" Quite a bit. He kills in rage. He lies. He oppresses. History of mankind is replete with man's inhumanity against his fellow man. But the wicked can do no more than what God permits. The Psalmist is not fearful of man because he is sure of God's presence with him. He is not fearful because his life is safe in God's hands.\n\nCHS: The LORD was on his side. God was for him. The Psalmist \"rejoiced in the divine help; all men turned against him, but God was his defender and advocate, accomplishing the divine purposes of His grace ... He does not say that he should not suffer, but that he would not fear: the favour of God infinitely outweighed the hatred of men ... [thus] he had no reason to be afraid. He was calm and confident, though surrounded with enemies, and so let all believers be, for thus they honour God.\"\n\nThere is a saying that goes, \"One with God is a majority.\" David was with God, and the mighty Goliath was no match for him. Daniel was with God, and the Babylonians could do nothing against him. The Psalmist was with God and thus he was fearless. Is God with you?"

[But] in raising Him from the dead the LORD God exalted Him to be the head of His church ... and He has become the confidence [of the redeemed - Jews and Gentiles alike].\"\n\nThe corner stone is also a place of preeminence. Rightfully, Christ is \"the head over all things to the church\" (Eph. 1:22b). He is the One \"in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord\" (Eph. 2:21). But sadly, today, there are only a few Christians who have Christ as their preeminence. To many He may not be rejected, but certainly He is laid aside. But what is the difference?

        "text": "\"Blessed be He that cometh in the name of the LORD.\" These are words of welcome. In the Psalmist's days, the Lord was the Coming One. In the time of the Apostles, He was welcomed but only briefly for He was soon betrayed and crucified. In our day, Christ is still the Coming One although He had already come once. Today, unbelievers scoff at the idea of a Coming Christ. But as God's people, we must be ready with our hosannas. We must be waiting and ready to receive Him with joy. Every believer must wait for His return with great anticipation, \"looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ\" (Tit. 2:13). The Psalmist refers to Him as the LORD - Jehovah - the God Who saves. Such wonderful knowledge can only be known by divine revelation.\n\nCHS: \"We have received light, by which we have known the rejected stone to be the head of the corner, and this light ... [shows that the despised Nazarene is the Prince of Peace]. Our knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ came not by the light of nature, nor by reason, nor did it arise from the sparks which we ourselves had kindled, nor did we receive it of men; but the mighty God alone hath showed it to us.\"\n\nThe Psalmist takes one step further. It is not enough to know that God is the LORD. He says, \"Thou art my God.\" Jesus asked the disciples, \"Whom do men say that I am?\" (Mark 8:27). The disciples told Jesus what others thought of Him. Then Jesus asked again, \"But whom say ye that I am?\" (Mark 8:29). It does not matter what others think of Christ. But it matters a great deal what you think of Him. Is the LORD your God?"

        "verse": "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. Blessed are they that keep His testimonies, and that seek Him with the whole heart. (Psalm 119:1-2)",
        "text": "The one hundred and nineteenth psalm is the longest psalm in the Psalter. It has 22 stanzas with eight verses in every stanza. It is acrostic, meaning to say that every verse of every stanza begins with a letter in the Hebrew alphabet. Thus the first eight verses begin with aleph; the next eight begin with beth. This acrostic pattern is marked by subheadings in the English versions.\n\nPsalm 119 is so rich that volumes have been written on it. The most impressive commentary was written by Thomas Manton whose three-volume work on this Psalm totalled 1,677 pages. This is a glorious psalm because it has a glorious theme - the Word of God. Almost every verse in this psalm has a reference to the Word of God. There are no less than eight synonyms for \"Scripture\" - law, word (dabar), word (imrah), ordinances, testimonies, commandments, statutes, and precepts.\n\nIt has always been man's desire and God's intent that man be happy. Throughout history, men have tried to achieve happiness by pursuing wealth, status, love, and power. But these pursuits always fall short because even the best of men's intentions are warped by sin. God offers a recipe for true happiness - \"Blessed are the undefiled in the way ... Blessed are they that keep His testimonies.\" Happiness is not a state - it is a journey - the more we walk in Him, the more blessed we will be.\n\nCHS: \"They are doubly blessed whose outward life is supported by an inward zeal for God's glory. Blessedness is ascribed to those who treasure up the testimonies of the LORD ... they search the Scriptures ... they love them ...  they continue in the practice of them ... If we keep God's testimonies they will keep us; they will keep us right in opinion, comfortable in spirit, holy in conversation, and hopeful in expectation.\""

        "text": "Doctor's advice is that we should get a full physical every year, and one that would include an examination of the heart, to make sure that its arteries are clear, its beats are regular, and so on. But more importantly, the spiritual heart needs to be examined too, and every believer needs to ask, \"What is the condition of my heart?\"\n\nWe keep our physical hearts in good working order by being careful about what we feed our bodies. Likewise, we keep our spiritual hearts in good condition by being mindful of what we feed our souls.\n\nWhen shall this feeding of the soul begin? - at the earliest possible moment in a person's life. Paul said that \"from a child,\" Timothy has known the holy scriptures (2 Tim. 3:15). The child is used in the Bible to refer to infants and even unborn babies. Many parents have been fed on the devil's lie that they must allow their children to make their own choices with regard to their religion. And while they wait for their children to be \"old\" enough to decide for themselves, the world poisons the children's minds.\n\nThus it is important that we take heed to God's Word. CHS: \"No nobler ambition can lie before a believer, none to which he is called by so sure a calling; but none in which greater difficulties can be found. Let him not, however, shrink from ... [the pursuit of a pure life] ... rather, let him enquire the way by which all obstacles may be overcome ... Let him become a practical disciple of the holy God, Who alone can teach him how to overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil ... Let him not be ashamed often to enquire [God's way because He] ...  is so ready and so able to instruct him in it.\""

There is also a narrow way that leads to life, and few there be that find it (Matt. 7:13-14). The broad way is also the popular way. Hence it should not surprise us that if we walk God's narrow way of life, we would be regarded as strangers in this earth. As Christians, we are strangers in the earth in the sense that we are mere passers- by. As the chorus tells us\n\nThis world is not my home I'm just a passing through,\nMy treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue\nThe angels beckon me from Heaven's open door\nAnd I can't feel at home in this world anymore.\n(Jim Reeves)\n\nWe are strangers also in the sense that we are out of place in this world. As Christians, we are called out of the darkness of the world by God Whom the world neither believes nor honours. And the only way for us to be successful strangers is for God to show us His way.\n\nCHS: \"The Psalmist was a stranger for God's sake, else had he been as much at home as world lings are: he was not a stranger to God, but a stranger to the world ... [If God's commandments are gone,] what have I else? ... What can I do if I lose Thy Word? ... God's commands were his solace in his exile: they remind him of home; and they showed him the way thither.\"\n\nThe Bible is our light through this dark world. If there is no light, what is the use of sight? We would be as hopeless without light as we would be without sight. Thus while we pray that God would open our eyes, we also pray that He would not hide His truth from us."

God heard his prayers and set before him the way of truth, implying that there is also the way of lies. Now we have to choose.\n\nCHS: \"A man must choose one or the other, for there cannot be any neutrality in the case. Men do not drop into the right way by chance; they must choose it, and continue to choose it, or they will soon wander from it ... There is a doctrinal way of truth which we ought to choose, rejecting every dogma of man's devising. There is a ceremonial way of truth which we should follow, detesting all the forms which apostate churches have invented; and then there is a practical way of truth, the way of holiness, to which we must adhere.\"\n\nOur life is a never ending series of choices. We have a choice every day - to live for God or to live for the world. Not to choose is in itself a choice. Man's own wilful choice, because of his fallen human nature, is never the way of God. It is only by God's grace that He grants us the will to choose the way of truth and holiness.\n\nHaving chosen, the Psalmist says that he laid God's judgements before him. It literally means to set God's judgements before our minds as the guide of our conduct and the aim of our lives. Holy living is unnatural to the natural man. We do not become godly by mere wishing, but there must be diligent study of Holy Scripture, deliberate observing of God's statutes, and a devoted commitment to our blessed Saviour."

        "text": "The Psalmist prays, \"Teach me, O LORD ... give me understanding.\" CHS: The Psalmist \"not only needs teaching, but the power to learn: he requires not only to understand, but to obtain an understanding. How low has sin brought us; for we even lack the faculty to understand spiritual things, and are quite unable to know them till we are endowed with spiritual discernment.\"\n\nThe natural man cannot understand spiritual truths (1 Cor. 2:14), and it is only by the grace of God through the illumination of the Holy Spirit that we can understand spiritual things (1 Cor. 2:12).\n\nWe need to pray for God's understanding; not so that we may be known as wise, but that we may know how to be godly. The Christian ought not to disdain divine wisdom because it is by the renewing of our minds that we are transformed (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23).\n\nChristianity is an intelligent faith. God gives us His Word so that we, in studying and obeying it, may be \"perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works\" (2 Tim. 3:17).\n\nHow shall I praise Him? Where shall I serve Him? Our understanding of God's will in these areas is important. We need God's understanding in worship because we must worship Him in spirit and in truth (John 4:24). Intelligent worship means that we must know the God Whom we worship, and we must praise Him with understanding (1 Cor. 14:15). We need God's understanding for our faith because our faith is resting upon God's promises. And to believe God's promises, we must understand what they are. We need God's understanding for our spiritual growth (2 Pet. 3:18). We need God's understanding in knowing God's will (Rom. 12:1-2). We need God's understanding in our witnessing so that we will \"be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear\" (1 Pet. 3:15).

        "text": "Liberty is not a western democratic concept. As a matter of fact, the western idea of liberty is a perversion of biblical liberty. Liberty, as the unbelieving world defines it, is the freedom to do as one pleases. Christian liberty, however, is to keep God's law continually. True liberty is to be freed from our own self- centredness so that we may be free to live for God.\n\nCHS: \"Saints find no bondage in sanctity. The Spirit of holiness is a free spirit; He sets men at liberty and enables them to resist every effort to bring them under subjection ... God's mercies and His salvation, by teaching us to love the precepts of the word, set us at a happy rest; and the more we seek after the perfection of our obedience the more shall we enjoy complete emancipation from every form of spiritual slavery.\"\n\nThus, the first thing in a man's life is to find the right master, and not your own freedom. When you have found the right Master, you will find freedom (John 8:36). But if you start with looking for your own freedom, you will soon find that you are a slave to every whim.\n\nTo be free in Christ is also to be free from the fear of man. The Psalmist says that he will testify of God's truths before kings. Martin Luther was brought before Emperor Charles V and the representatives of Rome at the Diet of Worms to recant his teachings. After a night of prayer, Luther said, \"My heart is held captive by the Word of God ... I cannot and will not recant. Here I stand. I can do no other.\" Like Martin Luther, we ought neither to be afraid of men nor be ashamed of Christ and His Gospel for it is the power of God unto salvation (Rom. 1:16)."

        "text": "What do you do when you are discouraged? Where do you go when it seems that the whole world is turned against you? David found himself in such a situation when his friends turned against him after their families were kidnapped by the Amalekites. The men who had sought David's help turned against him. In their grief, they even threatened to stone him, \"but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God\" (1 Sam. 30:6c).\n\nThe Psalmist too called upon God when he was in trouble. \"Remember the word unto Thy servant ... This is my comfort in my affliction\" (vv. 49-50). The word \"remember\" appears three times in this stanza (vv. 49, 52, 55). In verse 49, it was an appeal by the Psalmist to God to remember His promises. That was the Psalmist's hope; it was his only source of comfort.\n\nCHS: The Psalmist \"asks for no new promise, but to have the old word fulfilled. He is grateful that he has received so good a word, he embraces it with all his heart, and now entreats the LORD to deal with him according to it. He does not say, 'remember my service to Thee,' but 'Thy Word to me'\".\n\nThis was the Psalmist's personal plea, just like the thief's prayer to our Lord Jesus, \"Remember me\" (Luke 23:42). The hope is real only if it is true to you personally. It would be a tragedy if God's promise was remembered by all others but it did not come true to you. However, that will never be the case because the LORD will not forget anyone who calls upon Him.\n\nThe next two usages of \"remember\" were promises on the part of the Psalmist in which he asserted that he would never forget God's laws and His name. In other words, his faith in God would not change with circumstances. God is unchangeable, and His promises are sure. Our faith and true comfort must rest on His Person, His Word and His works."

        "text": "The Psalmist was not satisfied with the presents of God, he would rather have the presence of God; hence he said, \"Thou are my portion.\" What he meant was that God was his inheritance. This prayer reveals the heart of the Psalmist. After the children of Israel had conquered Canaan, they divided the land among themselves. But the Levites were not given any land. Instead, they were given 48 cities scattered all over the land so that they could minister to the people readily. They had no land, but they had a better inheritance. \"Unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance\" (Josh. 13:33). God was their portion. Likewise, when the Psalmist said, \"Thou art my portion,\" he wants nothing from God but God Himself.\n\nCHS: The Psalmist \"is lost in wonder while he sees that the great and glorious God is all his own! ... [He] has seen the prey [spoils] divided, and heard the victors shouting over it ... but he chooses the LORD to be his part of the treasure. This is a large and lasting heritage, for it includes all, and more than all, and it outlasts all ... [With so much in the world to seek after, the Psalmist] deliberately turns from all the treasures of the world, and declares that the LORD, even Jehovah, is his portion.\"\n\nTo claim God as our portion is the essence of true worship. We miss a whole lot of blessings if we praise God only for what He can do and neglect to extol Him for Who He is. When God is our portion, we naturally live to please Him. The Psalmist said, \"I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto Thy testimonies.\" This is one of the greatest turning points in every believer's life. When we come to recognise God for who He is, He will also come to us. We see ourselves for who we really are, as well as the direction that we are heading; and we will turn from our own ways and towards our Saviour. What a blessed change this is!"

        "text": "Why do bad things happen to good people? Philosophers and theologians have grappled with this question for centuries. The argument goes that if God is good, there should be no suffering; and if there is pain, God is not good, not powerful or both.\n\nGod dealt with this issue in the oldest Book of the Bible - Job. The existence of man's suffering is not inconsistent with that of a loving God. There are several reasons for suffering. We live in a fallen and imperfect world. \"Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward\" (Job 5:7). Suffering brings about repentance. Suffering that drives you to your knees in humble contrition before God is good.\n\nThere is a rare genetic disorder known as CIPA in which the person suffering from it does not feel pain, heat or cold. A person with this condition can be running a high fever or cut himself, but he feels no pain, and thus he does not seek treatment. Likewise, the sinner who does not feel the pain of sin will not seek God's treatment for his soul. The Psalmist says, \"Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept Thy word\" (v. 67). Suffering is productive. It is like the fire that burns off the dross and refines the gold (Rom. 5:3-4). Suffering glorifies God (John 9:1-3).\n\nThe Psalmist recognises the hand of God in his suffering; \"It is good for me that I have been afflicted.\" CHS: Affliction \"was overruled for good ends ...  Whatever he may have thought while under the trial, he perceived himself to be the better for it when it was over ... It is bad for sinners to rejoice in their sins, and good for saints to sorrow in God ... Very little is to be learned without affliction ... Experience teaches. There is no royal road to learning the royal statutes; God's commands are best read by eyes wet with tears.\""

God did not make man like how He made beasts. God fashioned us and gave us understanding to know Him and His ways (v. 73), even when the ways are difficult. The Psalmist prays for understanding of God's faithfulness in two areas - in His affliction and in His mercy.\n\nCHS: \"Because love required severity, therefore the LORD exercised it ... It was the faithfulness of God to His covenant which brought the chosen one under the rod. It might not be needful that others should be tried just then; but it was necessary to the Psalmist, and therefore the LORD did not withhold the blessing. Our heavenly Father is no Eli: He will not suffer His children to sin without rebuke, His love is too intense for that.\"\n\nGod Who is faithful and true to Himself must bring judgement upon sin, but He always chastens in love because amidst the affliction, there is God's abundant mercy.\n\nCHS: \"Having confessed the righteousness of the LORD, he [the Psalmist] now appeals to His mercy, and while he does not ask that the rod may be removed, he earnestly begs for comfort under it. Righteousness and faithfulness afford us no consolation if we cannot also taste of mercy, and, blessed be God [in whom there is multitude of mercy, and therefore we may expect it].\" This is exactly what we need - a need for God's chastening so that we may walk in godliness and a need for God's mercy to forgive our sins and to sustain us in our sorrows. God loves us, and He loves us too much to leave us in our sinful ways. We must \"put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness\" (Eph. 4:24)."

However, the Psalmist looks to no one but God for His deliverance. \"My soul fainteth for Thy salvation.\" Where does the Psalmist look for God's deliverance? In His Word.\n\nCHS: \"Nothing else could satisfy him but deliverance wrought out by the hand of God, his inmost nature yearned and pined for salvation from the God of all grace, and he must have it or utterly fail ... [He is sure that] salvation would come, for God cannot break His promise; nor disappoint the hope which His own word has excited.\"\n\nOur lives too must be infused with this hope - a hope that perseveres in prayer, one that increases our fervency in pleading with God, one that thrives in adversity, one that stimulates our faith and sustains our service.\n\nThe Psalmist is depressed but he is not defeated. Where does he find this enduring hope? Alexander Pope's famous line, \"Hope springs eternal in the human breast\", is often quoted to mean that man in his worst times will always hope for the best. That may be true, but it is both a foolish thought and a false hope, if our faith is anchored on our own mind and fortitude. Hope springs eternal in the human breast only if that hope rests upon the eternal God, and we can find and have that hope in His Word (vv. 81, 83, 86-88)."

One of the most practical benefits of Holy Writ [Scriptures] is guidance in the acts of daily life: it is not sent to astound us with its brilliance, but to guide us by its instruction. It is true the head needs illumination, but even more the feet need direction, else head and feet may both fall into a ditch.\"\n\nThere are Christians who take God's Word as a light to mean that God will give them detailed instructions to every decision in their lives. This is not the purpose of God's Word. It is light in the sense that it reveals to us God's instructions with regard to the conduct and priorities of our life. No worldly philosophy gives this illumination. Only the Word of God is able to light our paths; and it is only when we obey His written precepts that we will be walking according to His ways."

        "text": "The Bible tells us that we live in perilous times, when \"men shall be lovers of their own selves ... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God\" (2 Tim. 3:1- 4); and the situation deteriorates for \"evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse\" (2 Tim. 3:13a). How then can Christians \"live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world\" (Titus 2:12b)? The Psalmist's prescription - \"I hate vain thoughts: but Thy law do I love.\"\n\nCHS: \"The opposite of the fixed and infallible law of God is the wavering, changing opinion of men ... The thoughts of men are vanity; but the thoughts of God are verity ... [Man's thoughts are especially] vain in the sense of vain- glory, pride, conceit, and self trust ... [empty and frivolous,] evil, and foolish ...  [The Psalmist looks upon them] with a hate as true as was the love with which he clung to the pure thoughts of God.\"\n\nThe \"vain thoughts\" that the Psalmist hates are not merely futile ideas. They are also vacillating opinions of double-minded men. They worshipped Jehovah but also bowed to Baal. Elijah rebuked the Jews, \"How long halt ye between two opinions?\" (1 Kings 18:21).\n\nA double-minded man is one who is not comfortable to have both feet in the world, but he is not committed enough to have both feet in the church. He puts his hand to God's plough, but he is constantly looking back at the world. He worships God and gold. He prays to the Almighty, but he also pines for the world. He wants a semblance of piety, but he would not leave the pleasures of sin.\n\nChristians, beware of the sin of double-mindedness (James 1:8; 4:8). Fix your mind on God and His Word alone. Let it direct your thoughts. Let it renew your mind. Let it fire your heart. Fly to the divine Author. Let Him be your hiding place against worldly wisdom. Let the LORD be your shield against the attacks of apostasy. Let God's Word be your hope."

        "text": "Throughout the one hundred and nineteenth psalm, the Psalmist had kept the spotlight on the Word of God. The Psalmist loved the law of God. It was his source of hope and comfort. He had kept the judgements of God. However, under the weight of oppression from his tormenters, it seemed that the Psalmist had taken his eyes off the Word of God. According to the Masoretes - copyists of the Hebrew Scriptures - verse 122 is the only verse that makes no reference to the Word of God. Perhaps, the Psalmist was distracted by his enemies, but only for a moment. It was not long before he reaffirmed his love for the Word of God.\n\nCHS: \"Far from being swayed by the example of evil men, so as to join them in slighting the Scriptures, he was the rather led into a more vehement love of them ... It is the mark of a true believer that he does not depend upon others for his religion ... Wealth brings with it so many conveniences that men naturally esteem it ... and yet, in the judgement of the wise, God's laws are more enriching, and bring with them more comfort than all the choicest treasures. The Psalmist could not boast that he always kept the commands; but he could declare that he loved them; he was perfect in heart ... He judged God's holy commands to be better than the best earthly thing.\"\n\nWe live in the age of relativism. A thing may be true to one yet false to another. It can be true today but false tomorrow. Nothing is binding. Nothing is concrete. Nothing is absolute. But God's Word is absolute, and He demands the absolute. Thus, we who claim to love the Word of God must also resolve to \"hate every false way\", for we cannot love the right way without also hating the wrong ones."

        "text": "Are you fascinated by how some things in life come to be? Do you look at nature and stand awestruck by its majestic beauty? Or have you lost that sense of wonder? The post-modern man who has a \"scientific\" explanation for everything in the world has robbed himself of that sense of wonder. He shuts himself away from the reality that there is actually something much bigger than himself which cannot be explained - God. God alone is truly wonderful. He is the Wonderful, Counsellor (Isa. 9:6). His works are wonderful (Ps. 40:5). God has made us - fear-inspiringly and wonderfully (Ps. 139:14). And the Psalmist adds one more observation to this list -  God's commands are wonderful.\n\nCHS: \"Wonderful in their nature, as being free from all error ... wonderful in their effects as instructing, elevating, strengthening, and comforting the soul ...  It is wonderful that God should have borne testimony at all to sinful men, and more wonderful still that His testimony should be of such a character, so clear, so full, so gracious, so mighty.\"\n\nGod's Word is wonderful because it gives understanding. The Bible opens the window of our soul to all of life's questions - what is important and what is not; what is right and what is wrong; what our priorities should be. A man who finds the Bible too simple is either too proud to admit his lack of understanding or too lazy to study it carefully. The Psalmist says that God's Word gives understanding to the simple. The wonderful truths of the Bible are hidden from those who are wise in their own eyes. But the man who is simple is truly wise because he looks at everything through the prism of God's Word; and life becomes real and meaningful."

CHS: The Psalmist \"uses the sacred name [of God] in worship. He praises God by ascribing to Him perfect righteousness. God is always right, and He is always actively right, that is, righteous. This quality is bound up in our very idea of God. We cannot imagine an unrighteous God.\"\n\nWe also cannot imagine a righteous God Who overlooks the unrighteousness of man. Before we can stand in the presence of the righteous God, we must be declared righteous by Him. To be declared righteous is a judicial act. God, on the merits of His Son, declares sinners righteous not because He sets aside His laws, but that they are all met in Christ.\n\n\"Righteous art Thou\" - righteousness is what God is. God's righteousness is expressed in His Word. His righteousness is everlasting (v. 142). He is righteous in all circumstances (v. 143). CHS: \"Jehovah both saith and doth that which is right ... This is a great stay to the soul in time of trouble. When we are most sorely afflicted, and cannot see the reason for the dispensation, we may fall back upon this most sure and certain fact, that God is righteous, and His dealings with us are righteous too.\"\n\nI know of godly Christians who would read through the Bible and mark on the margins of some verses, the letters T and P. They stand for \"tested and proven.\" Christians who have clung on to the Word of God in times of trouble will testify that God is righteous altogether. His Word never fails. \"For all the promises of God in Him [Christ] are yea, and in Him Amen ... \" (2 Cor. 1:20)."

What the Church needs today is not more machinery or better, not new organisations or more and novel methods, but men whom the Holy Ghost can use - men mighty in prayer. God does not anoint plans, but men - men of prayer.\"\n\nThe Psalmist believes in prayer. This stanza is an instruction manual on prayer. In these verses, the Psalmist tells us how he prayed (v. 145), what he prayed for (vv. 146, 149-150), when he prayed (v. 147), how long he prayed (v. 148), how his prayer was answered (v. 151), and his whole experience of prayer (v. 152).\n\nThe Psalmist prays - he cried unto God with his whole heart. CHS: \"We cannot tell whether at all times he used his voice when he thus cried; but we are informed of something which is of much greater consequence, he cried with his heart. Heart-cries are the essence of prayer ... His whole soul pleaded with God, his entire affections, his united desires all went out towards the living God ... There may be no beauty of elocution about such prayers, no length of expression, no depth of doctrine, nor accuracy of diction; but if the whole heart be in them they will find their way to the heart of God.\"tin Luther gave a similar advice, \"When you pray, rather let your heart be without words, than your words without heart.\" God delights in the earnest pleading of His people. \"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much\" (James 5:16b)."

        "text": "The Bible warns us against an empty profession in Christ. This has been a problem among Christians throughout history. God told Ezekiel that \"they sit before thee as My people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness ... they hear thy words, but they do them not\" (Ezek. 33:31- 32). God also told Isaiah the same thing, \"This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me\" (Isa. 29:13). Our Lord Jesus also used the same words to rebuke the Pharisees. Central to faith is obedience to God. Faith without obedience is worthless. Bishop JC Ryle says, \"Open sin and avowed unbelief no doubt slay their thousands, but profession without practice slays its tens of thousands.\" Thus the Psalmist was rightly grieved when the transgressors kept not God's Word.\n\nCHS: The Psalmist \"was sorry to see such sinners ... They were a sad sight to me, however fine their clothing or witty their chattering ... My grief was occasioned more by their sin against God than by their enmity against myself. I could bear their evil treatment but not their neglect of Thy [God's] Word.\"\n\nBut lest we point out the mote in someone's eye and overlook the beam in our own, the Psalmist affirms his love for God's precepts. A precept is a principle to be practised. The Psalmist is not talking about theology but practical godliness through obedience. And obedience is not merely a matter of gritting our teeth and getting on with life. Obedience is coming to God and trusting in His Word; and allowing Him to quicken us to give us life (v. 156)."

        "text": "The Psalmist ends this great psalm with a clear and bold affirmation of God's promise, as well as His practical love and mercy. He prays, \"Let Thine hand help me\" (v. 173). Save me. \"Let my soul live\" (v. 175). He neither looked to himself nor his friends; instead, he pleaded with God for the Almighty alone was able and willing to save. This reminds us of Peter when he was walking on the water and beginning to sink. Peter did not look to his friends; instead, he cried out, \"LORD, save me.\" And \"immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand, and caught him\" (Matt. 14:31a).\n\nIf only sinners would be as desperate for God's salvation as Peter was desperate for Jesus' rescue. The Psalmist also has the same longing - \"I have longed for Thy salvation, O LORD.\"\n\nCHS: \"He knew God's salvation, and yet he longed for it; that is to say, he had experienced a share of it, and he was therefore led to expect something yet higher and more complete. There is a salvation yet to come, when we shall be clean delivered from the body of this death, set free from all the turmoil and trouble of this mortal life, raised above the temptations and assaults of Satan, and brought near unto our God, to be like Him and with Him for ever and ever.\"\n\nThat should be every believer's desire as well - it certainly was Paul's. He told the Philippians, \"For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you\" (Phil. 1:23-24). For every day that God gives to you on earth, there is a purpose. The Psalmist says, \"Let my soul live, and it shall praise Thee\" (v. 175a). The chief end of men is \"to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.\" Live your life to the fullest, but live it for the glory of God. Let your life praise Him."

        "text": "Psalms 120-134 are collectively known as the songs of degrees. Spurgeon describes them as a \"psalter within a psalter\". The word \"degrees\" refers to something that is ascending. There are several meanings as to what the degrees refer. There are some who say that degrees refer to the literary device in the psalms where one thought is carried to the next level. Others believe that the degrees refer to the steps in the temple. A third group says that degrees refer to the Jews going up to Jerusalem from Babylon at the end of their 70-year exile. The best explanation, in my opinion, is that these are songs that the Jews sang as they made their way to Jerusalem for the annual feasts.\n\nA pilgrim is a traveller, one who is on his way. The Psalmist sees himself as a pilgrim on this earth. He realises that he does not fit into the world around him. So he cries out to God, \"Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue\" (v. 2).\n\nThe Psalmist knows what it is like to be in this world. He has experienced it in Mesech and Kedar. He has even made friends with its citizens (vv. 5-6). Can truth abide with falsehood? Can Christ and Baal have any concord? Can we be at home in a world that is anti-Christ? CHS: \"A peace-maker is a blessing, but a peace-hater is a curse. To lodge with such [a peace-hater] for a night is dangerous, but to dwell with them is horrible.\"\n\nThe Psalmist is for peace, but he lives among those who are for war (v. 7). From the psalm, it does not appear that his prayer was answered. We do not always get what we want. David lived in the midst of treacherous \"friends\". Daniel lived among enemies. Let the words of Paul encourage you: \"If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men\" (Rom. 12:18); that would include quarrelsome ones.

The Jews must have sung this psalm as they made their way to Jerusalem. The journey must have been long and hard, but as the hills of Judah appeared in the distance, there was a fresh wind of strength; and thus they sang, \"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.\"\n\nThe reading in the Authorised Version seems to imply that the Psalmist was looking to the hills for God's help, but this is not the case. As the hills came into view, it was a sign that the Temple was near, and that it would not be long before he could worship the LORD Who made heaven and earth.\n\nCHS: \"What we need is help ... What a mercy that we have it in our God. Our hope is in Jehovah, for our help comes from Him ... Jehovah Who created all things is equal to every emergency; heaven and earth are at the disposal of Him Who made them, therefore let us be very joyful in our infinite Helper. We are bound to look beyond heaven and earth to Him Who made them both: it is vain to trust the creatures: it is wise to trust the Creator.\"\n\nThe Psalmist is not saying that the believer will only have bright and sunny days, but that the LORD will be just a prayer away at all times and in all circumstances, and especially in the bad ones. The Christian life is neither a walk in a well-manicured garden, nor a cruise in a super-liner; rather, it is a testing journey walking towards God, and all of us travel the same road and are on the same ground. There will be happy days and there will be sad ones. Everyone will grow old, get sick and eventually die. But the Christian's joy is that each day brings us one day nearer to the LORD Who made heaven and earth."

It is no wonder that exiled Jews could not sing the songs of Zion when they were in a strange land (Ps. 137:4), for their hearts were fixed on Jerusalem. In this Psalm, what we read is a spirit of renewal and rejoicing.\n\nCHS: \"Good children are pleased to go home ... David's heart was in the worship of God, and he was delighted when he found others inviting him to go where his desires had already gone: it helps the ardour of the most ardent to hear others inviting them to a holy duty ...

David was glad for his own sake: he loved the invitation to the holy place, he delighted in being called to go to worship in company, and, moreover, he rejoiced that good people thought enough of him to extend their invitation to him.\"\n\n\"Let us go\" is also a mark of Christian unity. It is the picture of a people from different walks of life whose hearts and minds are united in one call -  to worship God. Jerusalem is \"compact together\" (v. 3). The tribes \"give thanks unto the Name of the LORD\" (v. 4). How pleasant it is when God's people can unite our hearts together in our devotion to God."

However, justice must precede peace. The Psalmist describes the many thrones of judgement in the fifth verse before he asks for prayers for the peace of Jerusalem.\n\nChristians must pray and work for peace, but not peace at any price. The peace that God offers is the peace at the highest price - our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6). He is our peace (Eph. 2:14). He is the giver of peace (John 14:27). The peace that our Saviour gives is one that is sealed on the cross of Calvary. By His death, we can have peace with God (Rom. 5:1).\n\nJerusalem is a picture of the church. The church is for us what Jerusalem was for the Jews, and Christians too must pray for the peace of the church. CHS: \"In a church peace is to be desired, expected, promoted, and enjoyed ...  In a church one of the main ingredients of success is internal peace: Strife, suspicion, party-spirit, division - these are deadly things. Those who break the peace of the church deserve to suffer, and those who sustain it win a great blessing. Peace in the church should be our daily prayer, and in so praying we shall bring down peace upon ourselves.\"\n\nWhere there is peace, there will be prosperity. The word \"prosperity\" means \"abundance of quietness\". It is a beautiful description of what the church should be like - a place where believers can find rest in God and comfort from one another. The Psalmist is saying that those who love Zion will have peace, and the peace will bring more love which leads to more peace, and it goes on in a virtuous cycle. Our lives will be filled with the peace of God."

Psalm 123 is also known as the Psalm of the eyes. \"Eyes\" occur four times in the first two verses.\n\nBut God is an invisible Spirit; how could the Psalmist see Him?

God is in heaven ... where He looks down on the world and succours [comforts] His saints as their needs demand.\"\n\nThe eyes of faith are accompanied by a heart of devoted service. The Psalmist compares the longing of the believer to a servant's longing for his master. To lift up our eyes to the LORD is good. It is even better to lift up our hands to serve Him. Our Lord saved us and has committed to us the \"ministry of reconciliation\" (2 Cor. 5:18).\n\nCHS: \"True saints, like obedient servants, look to the LORD their God reverentially ... They watch, obediently, doing His commandments, guided by His eye ... They look continuously, for there never is a time when they are off duty; at all times they delight to serve in all things ...

It implies that none can harm us till the LORD permits: we cannot be their prey unless the LORD gives us up to them, and that our loving LORD will never do. The more imminent the danger, the more eminent the mercy which would not permit the soul to perish in it. God be blessed for ever for keeping us from the curse. Jehovah be praised for checking the fury of the foe.\"\n\nThere are people who like to dwell on hypotheses - the \"what if's\" - What if God has not saved us? What if God is not on our side? The Psalmist, on the other hand, sets his mind on reality. The reality is that God has not given us up as a prey. The reality is our soul has escaped the claws of condemnation. The reality is God is our Deliverer. This reality is secured by the name of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth (v. 8). Blessed be the LORD Who has made us by His spoken word. More blessed is the LORD Who has delivered us from evil through His dear Son."

        "text": "We live in perilous times. One social commentator once said that we are living in the new Dark Ages. The traditional family is breaking up, the society is breaking down, there is a war on terror; yet there is a culture of self- centred complacency. However, there is no danger that hits as close to home as when it actually does hit home, and we are immediately awakened to the perils of our times. Christians are not exempted from these trying times, but we are safe in the LORD because He Who watches us \"cannot be moved, but abideth for ever\" (v. 1). We also have His promise that righteousness will prevail.\n\nCHS: \"The people of God are not to expect immunity from trial because the LORD surrounds them, for they may feel the power and persecution of the ungodly ... The graceless often bear rule and wield the rod; and when they do so they are pretty sure to make it fall heavily upon the LORD's believing people ... [but] God has set a limit to the woes of His chosen: the rod may light on their portion, but it shall not rest upon it ... The rod of the wicked may fall, but ... it cannot have lasting sway.\"\n\nWe read in verse 3, the promise of God's deliverance. The Psalmist merely affirms what God has promised that He would do. God will deliver the righteous. As for how and when, these are His prerogatives, not ours. In verse 4, we also see the prayer for God's blessings. The Psalmist asks because no man is righteous and deserves God's blessing. And every blessing that comes into our lives must be due to God's hand of goodness upon us."

        "text": "The children of Israel, who were driven from their homes, returned after 70 years of exile. To them, homecoming was indeed a joy unspeakable. Their delirious exultation was quite understandable, \"The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad\" (v. 3). There are some experiences in life that would come close to the joy that the Jews felt when they set foot on Jerusalem again - recovering from an illness or returning home after a long absence. But above all these, salvation deserves the greatest joy.\n\nAs soon as the Jews resettled in Jerusalem, they were met with the huge tasks of rebuilding the temple, the wall, and their own lives. As in our own lives, there will be times of discouragement when the thrill of first joy gives way to the toil of daily grind. John Wesley once asked, \"Where is the joy I knew when I first saw the LORD?\"\n\nHowever, we should never despair. As surely as the night's darkness shall give way to the morning light, so will our tears be turned to joy. CHS: \"Present distress must not be viewed as if it would last for ever; it is not the end, by any means, but only a means to the end. Sorrow is our sowing, rejoicing shall be our reaping. If there were no sowing in tears there would be no reaping in joy ... Winners of souls are first weepers for souls ... When our own hearts are broken with grief at man's transgression we shall break other men's hearts: tears of earnestness beget tears of repentance.\"\n\nThere is nothing in this life and in the eternity to come that is more worth doing than saving souls. With tears, sow the Gospel seed. Do not give up. Do not cease to pray. And in His time, our Lord Who gives us the work will also send us the harvest."

        "text": "Solomon, who penned the one hundred and twenty-seventh psalm, also wrote the Book of Ecclesiastes; and both share a well-known theme - the vanity of life without God. The man who builds his house without God builds in vain. The man who devotes his time and talent in his own pursuits does so in vain. The motto on the coat of the Scottish arms of Edinburg reads, \"Without the LORD, Frustration.\" This is true for our lives as well.\n\nCHS: \"Men desiring to build know that they must labour, and accordingly they put forth all their skills and strength; but let them remember that if Jehovah is not with them their designs will prove failures ... Without God we are nothing ... We are not safe because of watchmen if Jehovah refuses to watch over us.\"\n\nPsalm 127:1-2 was quoted by Benjamin Franklin at the convention to form a constitution for the United States. Mr. Franklin had said, \"If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable then that an empire can rise without His aid? 'Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it.' I firmly believe this.\"\n\nIt is true for nation-building; it is also true for building homes and churches. Note that it is God Who first works - He builds and keeps. God's working does not save us from honest and diligent labour - we labour and watch. Oliver Cromwell, the Puritan general, often tells his troops, \"Trust God, and keep your powder dry.\" It is God Who makes our work for Him meaningful. And it is God, by His grace, Who grants us success in our labour. A mighty man may have a quiver full of arrows (v. 5), but everything will be in vain unless the LORD rules in his heart and his life."

        "text": "In Psalm 127, Solomon gives the formula for successful home building - God must be in it. In Psalm 128, we see the outcome of that method -  blessings upon the home. \"Blessings\" is the key word in this psalm. Blessing comes to the man who does two things, namely fearing the LORD and walking in His ways. To fear the LORD means to revere Him in awe. God is serious, and He must be taken seriously. He must be in the centre of your life. His will must be the reason for your every ambition. His strength must be the power of your working. His glory must be your goal. To walk in God's ways is to be obedient. Enoch walked with God, and his walk was one that \"pleased God\" (Heb. 11:5).\n\nBlessed is the man who feareth the LORD, for he shall be fruitful in his ministry as well as in his home. CHS: \"It is not every man that feareth the LORD who has a wife; but if he has, she shall share in his blessedness and increase it ... To complete domestic bliss children are sent. They come as the lawful fruit of marriage, even as clusters appear upon the vine. For the grapes the vine was planted; for children was the wife provided ... Good wives are also fruitful in kindness, thrift, helpfulness, and affection: if they bear no children, they are by no means barren if they yield us the wine of consolation and the clusters of comfort.\"\n\nThe children are like olive plants around the man. He is blessed with the wine of his wife (the fruitful vine), and the oil from his children (the olive plants). It is said that the olive tree takes about 15 years before it produces fruit. It takes almost as long before parents can see the fruits of their parenting. The Psalmist is not saying that God-fearing families will have no problems. There are godly parents who are grieved over the waywardness of their children. Yet the principle of a blessed home is this - Fear God and walk in His ways."

They were enslaved in Egypt, were attacked by the Canaanites during the time of the Judges, fought among themselves in the era of the kings, were exiled by the Assyrians and Babylonians, were ruled by the Greeks, were dispersed by the Romans, and were persecuted by the Nazis. Thus the Psalmist is right in saying, \"they afflicted me from my youth.\" Not just in her youth, but since then and will continue to be so until our Lord returns.\n\nNo other nation has gone through as much as Israel, and \"yet they have not prevailed against [her].\" Reason: Jehovah is righteous. CHS: \"Whatever men may be, Jehovah remains just, and will therefore keep covenant with His people and deal out justice to their oppressors ... Sooner or later a righteous God will interpose, and when He does so, His action will be most effectual; He does not unfasten, but cuts asunder, the harness which the ungodly use in their labour of hate. Never has God used a nation to chastise His Israel without destroying that nation ... He hates those who hurt His people even though He permits their hate to triumph for a while for His own purpose.\"\n\nTrue believers will suffer persecution. \"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution\" (2 Tim. 3:12; John 15:18-19; Matt. 10:22; 24:9). Yet the promise is that no tribulation or persecution can separate us from the love of Christ for \"in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us\" (Rom. 8:35-37)."

        "text": "Psalm 130 is an intensely personal one. It reads like a page out of the Psalmist's personal journal. It begins with a man in the depth of despair, and ends with him on the summit of saving grace. It was the hearing of this psalm at Aldersgate in 1738 that John Wesley said that his heart was \"strangely warmed\". The journey from the pit to the peak begins with an awareness of one's sinfulness.\n\nToday, the world talks about dysfunctions rather than sins. When man lives with little awareness of God, he also lives in oblivion of his own sinfulness. To the repentant sinner, sin is not a no-cure soul disease; there is forgiveness with God.\n\nCHS: \"Free, full, sovereign pardon is in the hand of the great King: it is His prerogative to forgive, and He delights to exercise it. Because His nature is mercy, and because He has provided a sacrifice for sin, therefore forgiveness is with Him for all that come to Him confessing their sins. The power of pardon is permanently resident with God: He has forgiveness ready to His hand at this instant ... None fear the LORD like those who have experienced His forgiving love. Gratitude for pardon produces far more fear and reverence of God than all the dread which is inspired by punishment.\"\n\nThere is forgiveness with God, not for some sins but for all sins. God's forgiveness is fully applied. There is no sin that God cannot forgive; neither is there a sin so deep that His grace cannot save one from. God's forgiveness is presently applied. The reality of forgiveness is now; the forgiven sinner does not need to live under the weight of his guilt. God's forgiveness is freely applied. It is free to all who would place their hope on Him (vv. 5-7). God's forgiveness is to be effectively applied. The man who is forgiven of his sins will fear the Forgiver even more. Grace binds the heart of the saint more tightly to the Saviour than sin could fetter his soul. The Psalmist whose sins have been forgiven says, \"My soul waiteth for the LORD.\""

On the contrary, he should be clothed in humility (1 Pet. 5:5). As much as pride is the first sin among the things that God hates (Prov. 6:17), humility is a principal virtue that God delights in (Isa. 57:15).\n\nKing David says that he has learnt to cease to \"exercise [himself ] in great matters\" (v. 1). This does not mean that he sits idly while the opportunities pass him by, but that he does not seek to make himself great. One writer says that the Christian who seeks to exalt himself is like building Babel while living in Eden.\n\nDavid also recognises that there are some matters that are beyond his comprehension. So he becomes like a child in the presence of God - with the wonder of calm contentment and the peace of total trust in God. David is like a \"weaned child\".\n\nCHS: \"The Psalmist had been upon his best behaviour, and had smoothed down the roughness of his self-will ... so that towards God he was not rebellious, even as towards man he was not haughty ... He had become as subdued and content as a child whose weaning is fully accomplished ... To the weaned child his mother [and not the milk] is his comfort though she has denied him comfort. It is a blessed mark of growth out of spiritual infancy when we can forego the joys which once appeared to be essential, and can find our solace in Him Who denies them to us.\" we too be weaned, and grow up to find joy and contentment in God and not just in His blessings."

        "text": "Psalm 132 is about the return of the ark to and the building of the temple in Jerusalem. It was David's desire to build a dwelling place for God. CHS: David \"could not enjoy sleep till he had done his best to provide a place for the ark. It is a strong expression ... the man was all on fire ... Everybody can see what he means, and how intensely he means it. Oh, that many more were seized with sleeplessness because the house of the LORD lies waste! ... He resolved to find a place where Jehovah would allow His worship to be celebrated, a house where God would fix the symbol of His presence, and commune with His people.\"\n\nWhen David told Nathan about his desire to build a temple for God, the prophet replied, \"Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee\" (2 Sam. 7:3). And although David did not get to build the temple, the LORD said to David, \"Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto My name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart\" (1 Kings 8:18).\n\nDavid was remembered not for his accomplishment but for his honest desire. Likewise, God does not measure our actions by the extent of our success, but by our sincere desire for His glory. Far better is the one-talent man who uses it for God's glory than the ten-talent man who employs them for his own interest. Far more praiseworthy is the industrious man who toils to see the LORD's work done and done well than the talented man who is indifferent to God's calling. May God give us the desire of David to be fervent about spiritual things."

Nevertheless, God also \"hath sworn in truth\" that He would establish the throne of David.\n\nCHS: \"He swears in truth, for He means every word that He utters ... 'He will not turn from it.' Jehovah is not a changeable being. He never turns from His purpose, much less from His promise solemnly ratified by oath ... He is not a man that He should lie, nor the son of man that He should repent. What a rock they stand upon who have an immutable oath of God for their foundation!\"\n\nGod's one promise has two facets. First, there is the promise to David and his heirs. Second, there is the promise of the Son of David, the promised Messiah, Who is the perfect King, and Whose \"throne shall be established for ever\" (2 Sam. 7:16b).\n\nGod's promise is balanced by the responsibility of David's sons - they must keep God's covenant. God's sovereignty has decreed that David's sons would rule, but His holiness also demanded that they be loyal to the covenant. We learn from this that election does not exempt us from obedience to God's Word. Rather, election enhances our obedience. God \"hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love\" (Eph. 1:4). This proves the importance of godliness in the home. As a writer once said, \"Grace does not follow in the blood,\" but let every man be filled with holy fear lest we or our children be drawn away by indifference or unbelief."

It is a double marvel, that the LORD should choose and desire such poor creatures as we are: the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in believers is a wonder of grace parallel to the incarnation of the Son of God. God in the church is the wonder of heaven, the miracle of eternity, the glory of infinite love.\"\n\nThroughout man's history, emperors, kings, and dictators have tried to set up a kingdom that will last forever.

CHS: \"We can dispense with uniformity if we possess unity: oneness of life, truth, and way; oneness in Christ Jesus; oneness of object and spirit - these we must have, or our assemblies will be synagogues of contention rather than churches of Christ. The closer the unity the better; for the more of the good and the pleasant there will be. Since we are imperfect, somewhat of the evil and the unpleasant is sure to intrude; but this will readily be neutralised by the true love of the saints. Christian unity is good in itself, good for ourselves, good for the brethren, good for our converts, good for the world; and for certain it is pleasant. A church united in earnest service of the LORD is a well of goodness and joy to all those who dwell round about it.\"\n\nThe Psalmist who calls us to behold the beauty of unity also calls us to behold the glory of worship. Worship in the church today is trivialised because believers are trivial. A writer once said that the \"common assumption of today's Christendom is that worship is primarily for us - to meet our needs.\" Some egocentric Christians worship so that they may be blessed, and thus we often hear responses like, \"I am blessed by the music and the message.\"\n\nThe Psalmist, however, calls us to bless the LORD. True worship is theo- centric. CHS: \"'Bless ye the LORD.' Think well of Jehovah, and speak well of Him. Adore Him with reverence, draw near to Him with love, delight in Him with exultation ... He blesses you; therefore, be zealous to bless Him.

Tozer once wrote, while the Bible Societies have been successful in disseminating Bibles, \"to great sections of the church, the art of worship has been lost entirely, and its place has come that strange and foreign thing called the 'program.' This word has been borrowed from the stage and applied with sad wisdom to the type of service which now passes for worship.\" Tozer wrote these words in 1948; since then, more sections of the church have turned the worship service into a \"program.\"\n\nWhat is worship? Some Christians find it difficult to define worship, and they do what seems right in their own eyes as long as it is clothed in sincerity. To worship is to ascribe worth. God is worthy because He is God. His worthiness is not determined by man. Thus, it cannot be left to man to determine how he wants to ascribe worth to God.\n\nIn Psalm 135:1-2, the Psalmist calls us back to biblical worship. All worship begins with an invocation - a call to worship. CHS: \"It is not enough for us to praise God ourselves ... let us call in all our friends and neighbours ... Let His character be extolled by you, and let all that He has revealed concerning Himself be the subject of your song ... [Let the holy] name of 'Jehovah' be the object of your adoration. By that name He sets forth His self-existence, and His immutability; let these arouse your praises of his Godhead ... 'Praise him, O ye servants of the LORD' ... You are 'servants', and this [worship] is part of your service; therefore celebrate His name with praises. We do not praise enough; we cannot praise too much. We ought to be always at it; answering to the command here given - Praise, Praise, Praise. Let the Three-in-One [Triune God] have the praises of our spirit, soul, and body. For the past, the present, and the future, let us render three-fold hallelujahs.\""

How frightful it would be if God is omnipotent and yet not good? But God is good. His wisdom is good so we can trust His promises; His power is good so we can rely on His strength; and His works are all good so we can count on His love.\n\nGod is love (v. 4). He chose Jacob because He loved him (Rom. 9:13a). God chose Jacob over Esau while they were still in the womb. This means that God did not choose on the basis of what you have done or not done. God's election is motivated purely by love. This reason alone is enough for us to praise Him.\n\nGod is great (v. 5). CHS: \"God is great positively, great comparatively, and great superlatively ... [The Psalmist] says positively, 'I know' ... He knew by observation, inspiration, and realisation ... He not only knows the greatness of Jehovah, but that ... [He] is infinitely superior to all the imaginary deities of the heathen.\"\n\nGod is sovereign. He does as He pleases (v. 6). CHS: \"His will is carried out throughout all space. The King's warrant runs in every portion of the universe ...  Jehovah rules over all. His decree is not defeated, His purpose is not frustrated: in no one point is His good pleasure set aside ... Jehovah works His will: He pleases to do, and He performs the deed. None can stay His hand.\"\n\nOne reason is enough to bring us to our knees in reverential worship. The Psalmist gives us more reasons than we need so that we may worship with greater understanding. And the more we know about the LORD, the more our reverence in worship must reflect that knowledge."

God is full of good works. The idols are full of no works. God does as He pleases. The idols are the result of what men do to them. God smote the nations and slew mighty kings.

        "verse": "O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: for His mercy endureth for ever. (Psalm 136:1)",
        "text": "Although Psalm 136 does not begin or end with the words \"Praise ye the LORD\" (hallelujah), it is known as the last of the Great Hallel psalms. To some Jews, Psalm 136 is the only Great Hallel (Great Hallelujah), and it is sung during the Passover, one of the great annual feasts celebrated by the Jews. The theme of this psalm is simple: It reveals God's continuous involvement in the redemptive history of Israel from the time of the Exodus to the conquest of the land. The Psalmist begins with this thrice-repeated call: \"Give thanks unto the LORD.\" The phrase \"give thanks\" is also translated as \"confess\" and \"praise.\" Hence, this is more than just a call of thanksgiving; the Psalmist is summoning God's people to worship.\n\nWhy do we thank God? The inspired poet gives us three reasons: God is good; He is the God of gods; and He is the Lord of lords. CHS: \"Essentially He is goodness itself, practically all that He does is good, relatively He is good to His creatures ... He is good beyond all others; indeed, He alone is good in the highest sense; He is the source of good, the good of all good, the sustainer of good, the perfecter of good, and the rewarder of good. For this He deserves the constant gratitude of His people.\"\n\nThe goodness of God is first seen in His creation. God is good because He made everything good (Gen. 1:31). Those who do not recognise God as the good Creator either worship creation or exploit them. The believer, on the other hand, looks at creation, and recognises the handiwork of God. The Christian understands that God has given us richly all things (including creation) to enjoy (1 Tim. 6:17). Hence, believers should value creation, and worship the Creator."

        "verse": " ... For His mercy endureth for ever ...  (Psalm 136:1-26)",
        "text": "Psalm 136 has three separate hymns - Hymn of Creation (vv. 1-9), Hymn of Deliverance (vv. 10-16), and Hymn of Conquest (vv. 17-26). But there is only one recurring refrain, namely \"for His mercy endureth for ever.\"\n\nCHS: \"We shall have this repeated in every verse of this song, but not once too often. It is the sweetest stanza that a man can sing. What joy that there is mercy, mercy with Jehovah, enduring mercy, mercy enduring for ever. We are ever needing it, trying it, praying for it, receiving it: therefore let us for ever sing of it, 'When all else is changing within and around, in God and His mercy no change can be found.'\"\n\nThe word \"mercy\" in Hebrew is hesed. It is also translated as \"lovingkindness\". Hesed is God's love, and it is a love that is enduring and unchanging. There are several reasons for the repetitive refrain. It may have been designed to be used in public worship as a response to the works of God. It may have been used as a literary device where the phrase acts as a foundation, and regardless of the circumstances, the foundational fact is that God's mercy endureth forever.\n\nThe blessed truth is that every work of God, be it the creation of the world, or the redemption of Israel, or the demonstration of His power and righteousness, is all evidence of His justice, serving as a foundation for our praising Him. All that we have gone through and experienced - good or bad -  is brought into our lives by the sovereign God Whose works are great, Whose purposes are benevolent, and Whose thoughts are to us-ward (Ps. 40:5). Hence, we too sing the glad refrain - \"God's mercy endureth forever.\""

        "text": "Psalm 136 has two voices. There is the voice of the beneficiary who sings the refrain; and there is the voice of the one who sings of the Benefactor and His wondrous works. He made the heavens. He smote Egypt. He led the people through the wilderness. He gave them the land. He remembered them in their low estate.\n\nCHS: \"Our prayer is, 'LORD, remember me,' and this is our encouragement -  He has remembered us. For the LORD even to think of us is a wealth of mercy. Ours was a sorry ... estate of spiritual bankruptcy and mendicancy ... The LORD seemed to have forgotten us, and left us in our sorrow; but it was not so for long: He turned again in His compassion, bethinking Himself of His afflicted children ... [We are] sinfully low in faith, and love, and every other grace; and yet the LORD has not forgotten us as a dead thing out of mind; but He has tenderly remembered us still. We thought ourselves too small and too worthless for His memory to burden itself about us, yet He remembered us.\"\n\nGod remembers us in our low estate for a reason - to redeem us. Israel was brought low by her enemies. They were enslaved, but God delivered them just as He has delivered us from the slavery of sin. It was a deliverance that came with a price - sinners were redeemed, and Jesus Christ is our Redeemer. This is the very essence of the Gospel - not that we remember God but that He remembers and redeems us.\n\nThus our worship and life must reflect this Benefactor-beneficiary relationship. The focus of worship is not on man but on God. It is not whether you feel good or not. Rather, it is \"Has God been exalted in your worship?\" Worship is the only thing that we can give to God. Do it well."

        "text": "Psalm 137 is a tale of contrast between two cities - Babylon and Zion. There is the historical Babylon which was the enemy of Zion. And there is the spiritual Babylon, the Mystery Babylon, and the spiritual Zion, which is the New Jerusalem (Rev. 18-22). Babylon represents the world of unbelief; Zion is the world of faith.ustine of Hippo used both cities as the backdrop for his book, The City of God. He wrote, \"Two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by the love of self, even to the contempt of God; the heavenly by the love of God, even to the contempt of self.\"\n\nThe Jews were recalling their days in Babylon. Despite the beauty of the mighty Euphrates and Tigris, the people could neither rejoice nor sing.\n\nCHS: \"How shall they ... sing in a strange land? With one voice they refuse, but the refusal is humbly worded by being put in the form of a question. If the men of Babylon were wicked enough to suggest the defiling of holy things for the gratification of curiosity, or for the creation of amusement, the men of Zion had not so hardened their hearts as to be willing to please them at such a fearful cost. There are many things which the ungodly could do, and think nothing of the doing thereof, which gracious men cannot venture upon.\"\n\nDistressed but not defeated, the Psalmist proves that he is determined to remember the goodness of God and the blessings of Zion. Note the change from \"we\" (v. 4) to \"I\" (v. 5). There is a sense that every Christian must remember God personally. Faith and commitment in the Redeemer must and can only be exercised individually. You must do it yourself. Remembering the LORD will eventually lead to rejoicing in Him. Recount God's goodness, and the songs of rejoicing will return."

The LORD had answered David's prayers, and He had strengthened David's hands (v. 3). Every experience in David's life was but another testimony to God's goodness and faithfulness. Whenever testing rolled in, David knew that God would be there to help the lowly.\n\nIn the same way, God will help those who are humble. When we become lowly and exalt God, He will, in turn, exalt us. But when we exalt ourselves in His presence, the LORD will bring us low so that we may have the real perspective of Who He is and who we really are.\n\nDavid knew God - He knew that God dwells on high. David also knew that God is not aloof and indifferent to us. When we walk in the midst of trouble, God will help us. CHS: \"If I am walking there [in the midst of trouble] now, or shall be doing so in years to come, I have no cause for fear; for God is with me, and will give me new life ... He is in a blessed condition who can confidently use the language of David - 'Thou wilt revive me.' Adversaries may be many, and malicious, and mighty; but our glorious Defender has only to stretch out His arm and ... we will be saved.\"\n\nThis assurance rests on God's love. We are not spared from walking in trouble, but when there is the promise of God's reviving, we can walk through the darkest valleys with confidence because the LORD will save us. John W Burgon wrote, \"God's creating hands formed our souls at the beginning; His nail-pierced hands redeemed them ... His glorified hands will hold our souls fast and not let them go.\" The LORD will save and \"perfect that which concerneth me.\""

It is a psalm that is rich in theology, for it deals with topics such as the omnipotence and omniscience of the Almighty God. It is also a psalm that is intensely personal (note the singular pronoun used), for it describes the relationship between the Psalmist and his God.\n\nThe Christian faith is not merely expressed in theological abstractions; it is also manifested in our personal relationship with God. This fact is trite but true. Hence, God is not just a distant all-knowing Being, but He is the One Who has searched me and known me altogether. And He is not a dreadful omnipresent God, yet He is One from whom you cannot escape.\n\nCHS: \"How well it is for us to know the God Who knows us! The divine knowledge is extremely thorough and searching ... This infallible knowledge has always existed - \"Thou hast searched me\"; and it continues unto this day, since God cannot forget that which He has once known. There never was a time in which we were unknown to God, and there never will be a moment in which we shall be beyond His observation ... nothing is concealed from Thee ... [even] the unformed word, which lies within the tongue ... is certainly and completely known to the Great Searcher of hearts. A negative expression is used to make the positive statement all the stronger: not a word is unknown is a forcible way of saying that every word is well known. O Jehovah, how great art Thou! If Thine eye hath such power, what must be the united force of Thine whole nature!\"\n\nTo the unbeliever, God's omniscience is threatening, and rightly so.

There are some who think that David was complaining about and trying to escape God's piercing gaze. Not so! On the contrary, David was comforted by the thought of God's omnipresence.\n\n\"Whither shall I go?\" David asked this question as an expression of the futility of one who tries to escape from God. Fly up into space, it is where God resides. Dive down to the deepest chasm of sheol, and God is there too. One writer correctly points out that hell is so fearful because it is the domain of the righteous God.\n\nWhat about taking flight to the east where the sun rises, or even to the seas where the billows roll? Even there, you will find that you are still in the palms of His hand (Isa. 40:12). Even the darkness is no shield. The fool thinks that he can hide in the darkness, but even darkness is God's domain (Isa. 45:7).\n\nCHS: \"No one can escape from the all-pervading being and observation [of God] ... From the sight of God he cannot be hidden ... From the presence of God we cannot be withdrawn. We must be, whether we will it or not, as near to God as our soul is to our body.

If God is not all-powerful, it means that there must be some power that is greater than He. If God is not all powerful, it means that His power can be curtailed and His will be thwarted. Praise God for His benevolent omnipotence.\n\nDavid recognised that God is all powerful but his understanding is far more than a mere theological abstraction. David saw God's omnipotence in his life, especially at the inception of life. Hence, David praised God - \"I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are Thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well\" (v. 14).\n\nGod's creation goes hand in hand with His counsel. It is impossible for a person to know the God of compassion without acknowledging Him as the God of creation. He is the Creator, and His creative concerns include individuals! In reflection, David exclaims the goodness of God - \"How precious also are Thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!\"\n\nCHS: \"That God should think upon him is the believer's treasure and pleasure. It is a joy worth worlds that the LORD should think upon us who are so poor and needy: it is a joy which fills our whole nature to think upon God; returning love for love, thought for thought, after our poor fashion ...  When we remember that God thought upon us from old eternity, continues to think upon us every moment, and will think of us when time shall be no more, we may well exclaim, 'How great is the sum!' Thoughts of our pardon, renewal, upholding, supplying, educating, perfecting, and a thousand more kinds perpetually well up in the mind of the Most High. Thoughts such as are natural to the Creator, the Preserver, the Redeemer, the Father, the Friend, are evermore flowing from the heart of the LORD.\"\n\nWhat a blessing it is indeed to know that God has us in His mind at all times! When we retire, God is ever with us. Even when we have closed our eyes for the last time on earth and get to open them again in heaven, we can say with David, \"When I awake, I am still with Thee.\""

David puts this in very stark terms, \"Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? ... I hate them [the sinners] with perfect hatred\" (v. 21-22). The popular adage is that Christians are to hate the sin and love the sinner but David makes no difference between the two. The sinner's sin is that of hating God. And David has only perfect hatred for the one who hates God. David was so consumed with the greatness and goodness of God that he did not want to be with anyone or do anything that would hinder that relationship.\n\nThe reason David keeps clear of the wicked is not that he thought himself to be too good for them, but because he cannot trust himself in such evil company. David, like all sinners, is prone to sin, so he prays that God would \"search him ...  try him ... know his thoughts ... and lead him in the way everlasting.\"\n\nCHS: David \"challenges the fullest investigation, the innermost search: he had need be a true man who can put himself deliberately into such a crucible ...  Exercise any and every test upon me. By fire and by water let me be examined. Read not alone the desires of my heart, but the fugitive thoughts of my head ...  Know with all-penetrating knowledge all that is or has been in the chambers of my mind. What a mercy that there is one Being Who can know us to perfection! He is intimately at home with us. He is graciously inclined towards us, and is willing to bend His omniscience to serve the end of our sanctification.\"\n\nDavid's prayer is serious. To know the truth in its truest sense, we have to walk in it. Blessed is the man who submits to the Almighty God, and lives under the light of His omnipresence. This is the key to a sanctified life."

David prayed for God's deliverance. CHS: \"No creature among the wild beasts of the wood is so terrible an enemy to man as man himself when guided by evil, and impelled by violence. The LORD by providence and grace can keep us out of the power of the wicked. He alone can do this, for neither our own watchfulness nor the faithfulness of friends can secure us against the serpentine assaults of the foe. We have need to be preserved from the smooth as well as the rough hands of the ungodly, for their flatteries may harm us as much as their calumnies [lies] ...  Evil hands will do what evil hearts have imagined and evil lips have threatened. LORD, preserve us by Thine omnipotence when men attack us with their violence. This prayer is a wise and suitable one ... [God alone] is the patron of holiness, and when the pure lives of His people are in danger of overthrow, He may be expected to interpose. Never let the pious forget to pray, for this is a weapon against which the most determined enemy cannot stand.\"\n\nBut lest we think that there are only some people who are evil, the Holy Scriptures remind us that man's \"heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?\" (Jer. 17:9; Rom. 3:12-18)\n\nAleksander Solzhenitsyn, writing about his experiences in the Russian Gulag, says, \"If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?\"\n\nIf we understand the depravity of our own souls (and David certainly did), then this prayer is not just asking for deliverance from the wicked, but also from our own sinfulness.

Prayer is one of those things in our Christian experience which we know is important yet of which we are seriously lacking. There are many reasons for this deficiency. One is the lack of God's presence in our daily lives. RA Torrey, a well-known Bible teacher, once said that Christians \"should never utter a syllable of prayer until we are definitely conscious that we have come into the presence of God.\"\n\nDavid describes his prayer as incense (v. 2), which is a symbol for prayer. In the Tabernacle, incense was continually offered to God so that the fragrance of the incense filled the Holy Place, a picture of the people enveloped in prayer.\n\nPrayer is conversing with God, and David wisely prayed that God set a guard over his mouth, heart and hands. CHS: \"That mouth had been used in prayer, it would be a pity it should ever be defiled with untruth, or pride, or wrath ...  David feels that with all his own watchfulness he may be surprised into sin, and so he begs the LORD to keep him ... When the LORD becomes the guard of our mouth the whole man is well garrisoned.\"\n\nDavid is also watchful about his heart and his hands. \"Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life\" (Prov. 4:23). The throne of a man is his heart, and whatever occupies that seat is the master of the soul. The hands do what the heart directs. The legs go where the heart leads. David was so conscious of sin that he would not eat of the dainties of the wicked. The world entices us with its morsels of delight, but as God's people, we must do well to stay away from them. Heed this advice - \"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the LORD out of a pure heart\" (2 Tim. 2:22)."

Keep me.\"\n\nCHS: David \"looked upward and kept his eyes fixed there. He regarded duty more than circumstances; he considered the promise rather than the external providence; and he expected from God rather than from men.

Peter learnt the same lesson on the Sea of Galilee. By faith, he stepped out of the boat into the tossing waves, and he was walking to our Lord Jesus. But as soon as he took his eyes off Jesus, he began to sink. Our Lord did not commend Peter for his faith; instead He rebuked him, \"O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\" (Matt. 14:31).\n\nFaith in Christ is the only way to come to Him. Our faith is God's gift. For Peter to put that faith to the test and saw it succeed, yet then fear as if Jesus would fail him, is to fail in his faith. The Bible gives us the same exhortation -  \"Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith; Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross ...

        "text": "Psalm 143 is generally regarded as the last of the penitential psalms. A penitential psalm is a cry for God's mercy. To be penitential is not to perform an act of penance; rather, it is to be repentant, having an inward change of the heart. David was no stranger to enemies, but in this case, he referred to only one enemy (v. 3), and it seemed that David's problems were due in part to God's judgement upon his sins.\n\nDavid's appeal for mercy was on the basis of God's faithfulness and righteousness. CHS: \"Saints desire to be answered as well as heard: they long to find the LORD faithful to His promise and righteous in defending the cause of justice ... Though clear before men, he could not claim innocence before God. Even though he knew himself to be the LORD's servant, yet he did not claim perfection, or plead merit; for even as a servant he was unprofitable ... To this day it stands true even to the same extent as in David's day: no man living even at this moment may dare to present himself for trial before the throne of the Great King on the footing of the law.\"\n\nDavid's confession was Paul's doctrine - \"by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight ... [but every sinner is] justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus\" (Rom. 3:20-24).\n\nThis is the thought that causes David to remember the LORD's past deliverances, meditate upon His present works, and muse about the enduring love that God has shown to him and every repentant sinner. If God has been faithful in the past, why should He fail in the present? He is the same today, yesterday and forever. Muse on the works of His hands."

It is not enough to stop doing wrong, the redeemed must also learn to do what is right in God's sight. David was not only concerned about God's deliverance -  he was also concerned about his walk with God. David needed salvation; he also needed God's direction.\n\nCHS: \"How childlike - 'Teach me'! How practical - 'Teach me to do'! How undivided in obedience - 'to do Thy will'! To do all of it, let it be what it may. This is the best form of instruction, for its source is God, its object is holiness, its spirit is that of hearty loyalty. The man is hidden in the LORD, and spends his peaceful life in learning the will of his Preserver ... 'For thou art my God' ... When the heart can sincerely call Jehovah 'my God,' the understanding is ready to learn of Him, the will is prepared to obey Him, the whole man is eager to please Him.\"\n\nDavid desired to be among the godly. He yearned for the land of grace, peace, and communion. David's holy desire was matched by his godly motivation. He sought to do God's will and he walked in God's way not for some pecuniary rewards but for the sake of God's Name. The narrow road and the strait gate is a difficult and trying journey. The way is steep and oftentimes trying. The godly way runs opposite to the reason and the impulses of the natural man. But by the grace of God and for the sake of our Lord Jesus, we press on, \"looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith\" (Heb. 12:2a)."

Who are we to claim the LORD as our own? What rights do we have to make this audacious assertion? And what demands do we have upon the divine privileges?\n\nCHS: \"What a contrast between Jehovah and man! The Psalmist turns from the glorious all-sufficiency of God to the insignificance and nothingness of man. He sees Jehovah to be everything, and then cries, 'LORD, what is man!' What is man in the presence of the Infinite God? ... Adam is like to Abel. He is like that which is nothing at all ... [He is actually vain, and he resembles that unsubstantial empty thing.] He is so short-lived ... His life is only like to a shadow ... Infinite condescension can alone account for the LORD stooping to be the friend of man. That He should make man the subject of election, the object of redemption, the child of eternal love, the darling of infallible providence, the next of kin to Deity, is indeed [amazing love].\"\n\nAlthough David was king, he was not oblivious to his own frailties. When David looked at himself, he saw vanity. But when he turned to God in faith, David found in Him everything. What a difference faith in God makes!"

The sparing of David's life would mean the peace and happiness of a whole nation ... Our sons are of first importance to the state, since men take a leading part in its affairs; and what the young men are the older men will be. He desires that they may be like strong, well rooted, young trees, which promise great things. If they do not grow in their youth, when will they grow? If in their opening manhood they are dwarfed, they will never get over it ... But when we see them developed in holiness, what joy we have of them! ... Daughters unite families as corner stones join walls together, and at the same time they adorn them as polished stones garnish the structure into which they are built. Home becomes a palace when the daughters are maids of honour, and the sons are nobles in spirit; then the father is a king, and the mother a queen, and royal residences are more than outdone. A city built up of such dwellings is a city of palaces, and a state composed of such cities is a republic of princes.\"\n\nThe dividends of God's salvation benefited not just David alone, but also his children. It started with one man who comes to God for salvation, and the blessings overflow to the next generation. Where godliness and righteousness is the tone and tenure of the home, our children will be blessed."

The theme of this psalm is David's praise to God the King. This is a great statement from David, who was Israel's greatest king. He recognised that there was One Who was greater than he. David knew it when he was sitting on the throne; and that he was a subject of the King of kings.\n\nWhat does the great King of heaven deserve? Our praise and worship. And what do we praise God for? His majesty and His works. A.W. Tozer says that man's language staggers when we talk about God. There are no words apt enough except the superlatives.\n\nCHS: \"David cannot give over the worship of God into the hands of others ...  he must have his own individual share in it ... His language labours to express his worship of Jehovah. Everything which has to do with the Great King is majestic, honourable, glorious. His least is greater than man's greatest, His lowest is higher than man's highest. There is nothing about the infinite LORD which is unworthy of His royalty; and ... nothing is wanting to the splendour of His reign: His majesty is honourable, and His honour is glorious: He is altogether wonderful.\"\n\nOthers will speak of the terrible acts of God's judgement, but David will declare the greatness of His grace.

One day, he was heard reciting his version of the Lord's Prayer. \"Our Father who does art in heaven, Harold is Thy Name.\" This boy's childish ignorance is a picture of Christians who recite the Lord's Prayer without understanding. When we come to the part of the Prayer that says \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,\" we are affirming that God is the King and we are His subjects; and that His will and not ours be done.\n\nCHS: David's \"meditation has brought him near to God, and God near to him ... He sees the great King, and prostrates himself before Him. It is well when our devotion opens the gate of heaven, and enters within the portal, to speak with God face to face, as a man speaketh with his friend. The point upon which the Psalmist's mind rests is the eternity of the divine throne ... The LORD's kingdom is without beginning, without break, without bound, and without end. He never abdicates His throne. None can overthrow His power, or break away from His rule ... Men come and go like shadows on the wall, but God reigneth eternally. We distinguish kings as they succeed each other by calling them first and second; but this King is Jehovah, the First and the Last.\"\n\nThe everlasting kingdom of God deserves everlasting allegiance from those who follow Him. There is not a moment to waste by having our loyalties displaced by some temporal thing or person. The words, \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,\" will be best appreciated by those who are subjects of God in the fullest sense; and those who are truly loyal to the LORD."

But the LORD lifts up those who fall. He provides for all who wait upon Him. The omnipotent and eternal King is also \"righteous in all His ways, and holy in all His works\" (v. 17). Another proof of God's covenant love for us is that He hears our prayers.\n\nCHS: God is near to us \"to sympathise and favour. He does not leave praying men ... to battle with the world alone, but He is ever at their side. This favour is not for a few of those who invoke Him; but for ... 'all' who place themselves beneath the shield of His glorious name by calling themselves by it, and by calling upon it in supplication ... [and to all who] find Him to be a very present help in trouble.\"\n\nThe Person to whom we direct our prayer is important. The heart by which we pray is also crucial. David says we must \"call upon Him in truth.\" Do not pray like the Pharisee who prayed thus with himself (Luke 18:11), and who prayed to be seen and heard of men (Matt. 6:5). Such prayers may tickle men's ears, but they will never move God's heart. The God of truth cannot be nigh to the spirit of hypocrisy. To call upon God in truth, we must first have a true heart. Verse 15 is one of David's last words in the Psalter. The man of God's own heart ended with a legacy of praise - \"My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless His holy name for ever and ever\" (v. 21)."

        "text": "The remaining five psalms of the Psalter are collectively and appropriately known as the Hallelujah Psalms. Like the final movement of a symphony usually ends majestically, so the Psalms would end with a crescendo of praises to the Almighty God. In Psalm 146, the writer praises Jehovah when he juxtaposes God's faithfulness with man's failings. Note the number of verses that are dedicated to God - He is the Creator, Judge, Provider, Liberator, Preserver, Protector of the weak, and the eternal King (Ps. 146:6-10). Comparatively, there are only a few verses reserved for men - he is helpless; he is no help; and he is as transient as his breath. Heed the Psalmist's counsel - \"Put not your trust in princes.\"\n\nCHS: \"Men are always far too apt to depend upon the great ones of earth, and forget the Great One above; and this habit is the fruitful source of disappointment. Princes are only men, and men with greater needs than others; why, then, should we look to them for aid? They are in greater danger, are burdened with greater cares, and are more likely to be misled than other men; therefore, it is folly to select them for our confidence ... Man is a helpless creature without God; therefore, look not for help in that direction. All men are like the few men who are made into princes, they are more in appearance than in reality, more in promising than in performing, more apt to help themselves than to help others.\"\n\nMan not only fails in his words, but he also fails in his thoughts. His opinions vacillate; his \"assertions\" are uncertain; his loyalties are divided. However, what is said of man in general should be said of God's people. As Christians, we must live honestly so as to be deserving of every man's trust."

Verse two describes the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. Lest we think that God is only involved in big projects, the Psalmist adds that He also heals the broken-hearted.\n\nCHS: \"The LORD is not only a Builder, but a Healer; He restores broken hearts as well as broken walls. The kings of the earth think to be great through their loftiness; but Jehovah becomes really so by His condescension. Behold, the Most High has to do with the sick and the sorry, with the wretched and the wounded! ... Few will associate with the despondent, but Jehovah chooses their company, and abides with them till He has healed them by His comforts ...  Come, broken hearts, come to the Physician Who never fails to heal: uncover your wounds to Him Who so tenderly binds them up!\"\n\nWhat a blessing it is to be broken-hearted and to have the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort as our Healer. God is like the Samaritan who went out of his way to tend to the needs of the man who had been robbed and left for dead. While other men passed by the man without so much as a hint of concern, the Samaritan showered his compassion on the stranger. Such is the magnitude of the love of our Saviour. He is the Shepherd Who leaves the flock and goes out in search of one lost sheep.

I'll give Him my heart.\" This Christmas poem by English poet Christina Rossetti expresses not only the Christian's desire but also God's delight. God has no pleasure in the brute strength of His creatures. He does not even delight in the physical excellence of man.\n\nCHS: \"'He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.' These are the athlete's glory, but God hath no pleasure in them. Physical or material greatness and power are of no account with Jehovah. Men who boast in fight the valour of gigantic might will not find themselves the favourites of God ... The Lord of hosts has no pleasure in mere bone and muscle ... God does not take pleasure in us because of our attainments ... He respects character rather than capacity ... While the bodily powers give no content to God, spiritual qualities are His delight. He cares most for those emotions which centre in Himself: the fear which He approves is fear of Him, and the hope which He accepts is hope in His mercy ...  They fear, for they are sinners; they hope, for God is merciful. They fear Him, for He is great; they hope in Him, for He is good. Their fear sobers their hope; their hope brightens their fear: God takes pleasure in them both in their trembling and in their rejoicing.\"\n\nTherein is the hope of any and every man. If God has decided to find pleasure only in the strong, the intelligent or the rich, few would be able to stand in His presence. But God delights in the one who fears Him; that is one thing that every man - rich or poor, strong or weak - can do."

Our Lord Jesus invites us to \"search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me\" (John 5:39). John Wesley wrote, \"Let me be homo unius libri [a man of one book].\" Similarly, the Psalmist praised God Who \"sheweth His Word unto Jacob.\"\n\nCHS: God \"Who is the Creator is also the Revealer. We are to praise the LORD above all things for His manifesting Himself to us ... Whatever part of His mind He discloses to us, whether it be a word of instruction, a statute of direction, or a judgement of government, we are bound to bless the LORD for it. He Who causes summer to come in the place of winter has also removed the coldness and death from our hearts by the power of His Word, and this is abundant cause for singing unto His name. As Jacob's seed of old were made to know the LORD, even so are we in these latter days; wherefore, let His name be magnified among us.\"\n\nOf all people, why did God choose to reveal to Jacob alone? And why only Israel? This is the mystery of God's amazing grace and His electing love. But there is a purpose to God's election - the election call is the loudest call for adoration. Man has no answers to God's sovereign work, but the elect knows the purpose of it - God's people are bound by gratitude to sing hallelujahs to His Name."

The whole creation is a continuous hymn of praise unto the God of creation.\n\nThe Psalmist begins with the angelic hosts. \"Praise ye Him, all His angels: praise ye Him, all His hosts\" (v. 2). The pagans worship angels, sun, moon, stars, and every cosmic phenomenon as if these came into existence by themselves. The Psalmist, on the contrary, directs his worship not at creation, but at the Creator. The LORD not only created; He had also eternally set in place the movement of the heavenly bodies.

[Thus] the eternal hymn is forever chanted; even the solemn silence of the spheres [planets] is a perpetual Psalm.\"\n\nThe immutable God Who rules the universe also rules in our lives.

The whole creation can only praise God by their silent existence; only man is created with a mind to know God, with a heart to love Him, and with a voice to sing His praise. And when man refuses to worship God and substitutes Him with one of His creatures, it is the most grievous of sins. Thus the Psalmist calls on us to praise God for His name alone is excellent.\n\nCHS: \"All that is contained in the name or character of Jehovah is worthy of praise, and all the objects of His creating care will be too few to set it forth in its completeness ...  [His Name] alone deserves to be exalted in praise, for alone it is exalted in worth. There is none like unto the LORD, none that for a moment can be compared unto Him ...

The Psalmist says that it is the LORD Who \"exalteth the horn of His people, the praise of all His saints\" (v. 14a), meaning to say that God will make His blessings so abundant that it would be impossible for us to be superfluous in our praises for Him."

This precious gift has been given to man alone that he might thereby remind himself that God has created man for the express purpose of praising and extolling God.\"\n\nCHS: \"Sing, for it is the fittest method for expressing reverent praise. Sing a hymn newly composed, for you have now a new knowledge of God. He is ever new in His manifestations; His mercies are new every morning; His deliverances are new in every night of sorrow; let your gratitude and thanksgivings be new also ...

The new song is not new in the sense of frivolous novelty. The new song is simply an eternal truth that is sung with a renewed heart.

Whenever we assemble for holy purposes our main work should be to present praises unto the LORD our God.\"\n\nIt would be a gross omission on the part of God's people if we think that the sanctuary refers only to the church building; and worship as a once-a-week activity. The Holy Scriptures tell us that our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. 6:19), meaning to say that where we are, that is, God's sanctuary, and what we do there is worship. Frances Havergal's famous hymn touches on this idea.\n\nTake my life, and let it be consecrated, LORD, to Thee.\nTake my moments and my days; let them flow in ceaseless praise ... \nTake my will, and make it Thine ... Take my heart, it is Thine own ... \nTake my love ... Take myself, and I will be ever, only, all for Thee.\n\nAllow me to end this last devotion of the year with a personal testimony. This daily devotional through the Psalms accompanied by Charles Spurgeon's Treasury of David was first published in 2006 as a biweekly Bible-reading guide. I had embarked on this arduous work because there was a need - a need to re-introduce daily worship within the covenant home; a need to re-establish a godly habit of Bible reading within the Christian home. There is much truth to the often-quoted and under-practised adage that says \"the family that prays together stays together.\" We pray that this book proves helpful in making the Word of God an integral part of your daily life. \"Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.\" Amen."
